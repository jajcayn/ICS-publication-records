The basis for the analysis were the meteorological data from a 30-year database (1982-2011) of daily air temperature and precipitation measurements and time-matched reports of TBE cases defined by the onset of symptoms. A semi-parametric Poisson regression model revealed a statistically significant relationship between the average daily ambient air temperature and incidence of TBE. The shapes of the dependence were similar in all three regions under study. The analysis of the available data did not show a statistically significant relationship between the precipitation amount and incidence of TBE. Other statistically significant predictors were the trend over calendar years, monthly seasonality and trend-seasonality interaction (the shape of the monthly seasonality varies over years), and day of week. The climate changes had differentiated effects on TBE increase depending on the local environmental conditions as can be illustrated by the variations between the three regions not only in the TBE incidence level but also in the shape of the trend over years.","","","","","inprint online nefunčniDOI  10.15761/VRR.1000103","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2017","2018","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0270914","RVO:67985807","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objectives This study evaluated the differential role of insulin versus no insulin therapy on thromboembolic risk in patients with diabetes and AF. Methods We accessed individual patient data from the prospective, real-world, multicenter, PREFER in AF (European Prevention of thromboembolic events-European Registry in Atrial Fibrillation). We compared the rates of stroke/systemic embolism at 1 year according to diabetes status (no diabetes, diabetes without insulin therapy, diabetes on insulin therapy). Results In an overall population of 5,717 patients, 1,288 had diabetes, 22.4% of whom were on insulin. For patients with diabetes who were on insulin, there was a significantly increased risk of stroke/systemic embolism at 1 year versus either no diabetes (5.2% vs. 1.9%; hazard ratio: 2.89; 95% confidence interval: 1.67 to 5.02; p = 0.0002) or diabetes without insulin treatment (5.2% vs. 1.8%; hazard ratio: 2.96; 95% confidence interval: 1.49 to 5.87; p = 0.0019). Notably, rates of stroke/embolism were similar in patients with diabetes not receiving insulin versus patients without diabetes (hazard ratio: 0.97; 95% confidence interval: 0.58 to 1.61; p = 0.90). The selective predictive role of insulin-requiring diabetes was independent of potential confounders, including diabetes duration, and was maintained in various subpopulations, including the subgroup receiving anticoagulant therapy. Conclusions In this cohort of anticoagulated patients with AF, the sole presence of diabetes not requiring insulin did not imply an increased thromboembolic risk. Conversely, insulin-requiring diabetes contributed most, if not exclusively, to the overall increase of thromboembolic risk in AF","","","","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2017","2018","","10.1016/j.jacc.2016.10.069","wos:000392994500007","2-s2.0-85010341421","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0270876","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Dynamical complex systems are then typically represented by a graph of temporal dependencies between time series of state variables of their subunits. It has been shown recently that graphs constructed in this way tend to have relatively clustered structure, potentially leading to spurious detection of small-world properties even in the case of systems with no or randomly distributed true interactions. However, the strength of this bias depends heavily on a range of parameters and its relevance for real-world data has not yet been established. In this work, we assess the relevance of the bias using two examples of multivariate time series recorded in natural complex systems. The first is the time series of local brain activity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging in resting healthy human subjects, and the second is the time series of average monthly surface air temperature coming from a large reanalysis of climatological data over the period 1948–2012. In both cases, the clustering in the thresholded correlation graph is substantially higher compared with a realization of a density-matched random graph, while the shortest paths are relatively short, showing thus distinguishing features of small-world structure. However, comparable or even stronger small-world properties were reproduced in correlation graphs of model processes with randomly scrambled interconnections. This suggests that the small-world properties of the correlation matrices of these real-world systems indeed do not reflect genuinely the properties of the underlying interaction structure, but rather result from the inherent properties of correlation matrix.","","","","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2017","2018","","10.1063/1.4977951","","2-s2.0-85015619793","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0270867","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: EWS history was obtained for 61 relapses resulting in hospitalization involving 51 patients with schizophrenia. Up to 20 weeks of EWS history per case were evaluated using a non-parametric bootstraptest and generalized mixed-effects model to test the significance and homogeneity of the findings. Results: A statistically significant increase in EWS sum score was detectable 5 weeks before hospitalization. However, analysis of EWS dynamics revealed a gradual, monotonic increase in EWS score acrossduring the 8 weeks before a relapse.

Disagreements in QRSd measurements were also found in several automated algorithms tested on digitized electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. The aim of our study was to investigate the variability of automated QRSd measurements performed by two commercially available electrocardiographs. Methods and results: Two GE MAC 5000 (GE-1 and GE-2) electrocardiographs and two Mortara ELI 350 (Mortara-1 and Mortara-2) electrocardiographs were used in the study. Participants for the study were recruited from patients hospitalized in the department of cardiology of a university hospital. Participants underwent up to four recording sessions within a single day with a different electrocardiograph at each session when two to four immediately successive ECG recordings were undertaken. In 76 patients, 683 ECGs were recorded; the mean QRSd was 109.0 +/- 26.1 ms. The QRSd difference >= 10 ms between the first and second intra-session ECG was found in 7, 3, 20, and 14% of ECG pairs for GE-1, GE-2, Mortara-1, and Mortara-2, respectively. No inter-session difference in QRSd was found within both manufacturers. In individual patients, Mortara calculated the mean QRSd to be longer by 7.3 ms (95% CI: 6.2–8.5 ms, P < 0.0001) with a 2.1-times (95% CI: 1.9–2.4) greater standard deviation of the mean QRSd (7.1 vs. 3.3 ms, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Electrocardiographs from two manufacturers measured QRSd values with a systematic difference and a significantly different level of precision. This may have important clinical implications in selection of suitable candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy.","","","FA","","inprint online","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2017","2018","","10.1093/europace/euw015","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0270802","RVO:67985807","","","","","","","","","","",""

The application also aspires to be a simple tool for routine analysis by allowing the users to upload and analyze their own data and by generating analysis report. We conclude by arguing that psychometric analysis should be a routine part of test development in order to gather proofs of reliability and validity of the measurement.

The FRAP method resides in imaging the recovery of fluorescence intensity over time in a region of interest previously bleached by a high-intensity laser pulse. While the basic principles of FRAP are simple and the experimental setup is usually fixed, quantitative FRAP data analysis is not well developed. Different models and numerical procedures are used for the underlying model parameter estimation without knowledge of how robust the methods are, i.e., the parameter inference step is not currently well established. In this paper we rigorously formulate the inverse problem of model parameter estimation (including the sensitivity analysis), making possible the comparison of different FRAP parameter inference methods. Then, in a study on simulated data, we focus on how three different methods for inference influence the error in parameter estimation.

After explaining a number of methodological approaches, we test for gender bias in two scenarios that demonstrate why DIF analysis is crucial for developing assessments, particularly because simply comparing two groups’ total scores can lead to incorrect conclusions about test fairness. First, a significant difference between groups on total scores can exist even when items are not biased, as we illustrate with data collected during the validation of the Homeostasis Concept Inventory. Second, item bias can exist even when the two groups have exactly the same distribution of total scores, as we illustrate with a simulated data set. We also present a brief overview of how DIF analysis has been used in the biology education literature to illustrate the way DIF items need to be re-evaluated by content experts to determine whether they should be revised or removed from the assessment. Finally, we conclude by arguing that DIF analysis should be used routinely to evaluate items in developing conceptual assessments. These steps will ensure more equitable - and therefore more valid-scores from conceptual assessments.","","","AM","","inprint","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2017","2018","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0270560","RVO:67985807","","","","","","","","","","",""

We developed a framework congregating the geophysical processes involved, customizable with alternative formulations, and that can be used as basis for novel couplers of atmospheric and oceanographic model components. We tested it with fine resolution data from the European coastal ocean. Although the solubility formulations agreed well, their minor divergences yielded differences of many tons of greenhouse gases dissolved at the ocean surface. The transfer velocities largely mismatched their estimates, in part consequence of the standard formulation not considering factors that were proved determinant at the coastal ocean.

Our testbed provides ROS-based Stage simulation of the model problem reified in a swarm of Turtlebot robots. The testbed ties this to timing-, bandwidth- and mobility-aware simulation of the robot communication (based on OMNeT++). To enable fast prototyping, the testbed abstracts robots as autonomous components (implemented in Java) and allows describing robot communication via dynamic collaboration groups (ensembles).

The GNSS products from the post-processing and (near) real-time solutions are also convenient for a long-term assessment and early monitoring of numerical weather predictions (NWP). In July 2015, we thus started a routine generation of GNSS tropospheric parameters in real-time using a mesoscale NWP model. Additionally, we evaluated NWP-derived tropospheric parameters with respect to the length of the prediction.

This complexity measure has recently been introduced for feedforward architectures (i.e., threshold circuits). We shortly survey the tradeoff results which relate the energy to other complexity measures such as the size and depth of threshold circuits. We generalize the energy complexity for recurrent architectures which counts the number of simultaneously active neurons at any time instant of a computation. We present our energy-time tradeoff result for the recurrent neural nets which are known to be computationally as powerful as the finite automata. In particular, we show the main ideas of simulating any deterministic finite automaton by a low-energy optimal-size neural network. In addition, we present a lower bound on the energy of such a simulation (within a certain range of time overhead) which implies that the energy demands in a fixedsize network increase exponentially with the frequency of presenting the input bits.","","","IN","","náhrada za 0442795 , původně zařazeno na přání autora jako kapitola v knize *** bylo označeno pro hodui2015 a bylo invited","ICANN 2013.

This stems partly from the fact that the concerns of self-adaptivity and dependability are to an extent contradictory. In this paper, we introduce IRM-SA (Invariant Refinement Method for Self-Adaptation) a design method and associated formally grounded model targeting siCPS that addresses self-adaptivity and supports dependability by providing traceability between system requirements, distinct situations in the environment, and predefined configurations of system architecture. Additionally, IRM-SA allows for architecture self adaptation at runtime and integrates the mechanism of predictive monitoring that deals with operational uncertainty. As a proof of concept, it was implemented in DEECo, a component framework that is based on dynamic ensembles of components. Furthermore, its feasibility was evaluated in experimental settings assuming decentralized system operation.","","","JC","","na žádost TB se nehlásí do RIV za UI","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","","2016","2017","","10.1016/j.jss.2016.02.028","wos:000387627200024","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0269725","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

They typically operate in uncertain environments and thus require means for managing variability at run-time. Architectural modes have traditionally been a proven means for the runtime variability. They are easy to understand, easy to realize in resource-constrained systems and (contrary to more sophisticated methods of learning) provide an explicit specification that can be inspected and validated at design time. However, in uncertain environments (which is the case of sCPS), they tend to lack expressivity to take into account the level of uncertainty and factor it in the mode-switching logic. In this paper we present a rich language to specify mode-switch guards. The semantics of the language is based on statistical tests, which, as we show, is a convenient way to reason about uncertainty in the state of the environment.","","","JC","","na žádost TB se nehlásí do RIV za UI","WICSA 2016.

An estimator of common breaks in panel means without a boundary issue for this kind of scenario is proposed. In particular, the novel estimator is able to detect a common break point even when the change happens immediately after the first time point or just before the last observation period. Another advantage of the elaborated change point estimator is that it results in the last observation in situations with no structural breaks. The consistency of the change point estimator in panel data is established. The results are illustrated through a simulation study. As a by-product of the developed estimation technique, a theoretical utilization for correlation structure estimation, hypothesis testing and bootstrapping in panel data is demonstrated. A practical application to non-life insurance is presented, as well.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2017","2017","","10.3390/risks5010007","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0268738","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The locally most powerful sequential rank test is derived for the hypothesis of randomness against a general alternative, including the two-sample difference in location or regression in location as special cases for the alternative hypothesis. Further, the locally most powerful sequential rank tests are derived for the one-sample problem and for independence of two samples in an analogous spirit as the classical results of Hájek and Šidák (1967) for (classical) ranks. The locally most powerful tests are derived for a fixed sample size and the results bring arguments in favor of existing tests. In addition, we propose a sequential testing procedure based on these statistics of the locally most powerful tests. Principles of such sequential testing are explained on the two-sample Wilcoxon test based on sequential ranks.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2017","2018","","10.1080/07474946.2016.1275501","wos:000395716300012","2-s2.0-85014910914","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0268685","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We study an intermediate model of binary-state neural networks with integer weights, corresponding to finite automata, which is extended with an extra analog unit with rational weights, as already two additional analog units allow for Turing universality. We characterize the languages that are accepted by this model in terms of so-called cut languages which are combined in a certain way by usual string operations. We employ this characterization for proving that the languages accepted by neural networks with an analog unit are contextsensitive and we present an explicit example of such non-contextfree languages. In addition, we formulate a sufficient condition when these networks accept only regular languages in terms of quasi-periodicity of parameters derived from their weights.","","","IN","","inprint *** údaje o sborníku *** stranky","IJCNN 2017.

The structure of the two models, their strengths and weaknesses, are presented. The models performance is thoroughly compared with the performance of a simple linear model tested under the frame of the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action ""Weather Intelligence for Renewable Energies"", as a benchmark used also in the forecasting exercise reported in Sperati et al. Energies 8 (2015) 9594. The models are used to forecasting the output power at time horizons of 1-72 h ahead. The data used during the COST competition are used here as input. The present study extends beyond the traditional evaluation of overall model accuracy. Detailed influences of seasonal effects, sun elevation angle and solar irradiance level upon the models performance are assessed. While the accuracy of the simple linear model is not entirely bad, it differs in important details from the two advanced forecasting models. The results show that a moderate, carefully chosen increase in model structure complexity can improve the predictive performance. Suitable penalty on model complexity can help both to enforce parsimony and improve practical forecasting abilities, to a certain extent. The physically inspired GAM comes out as the best performing model.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2017","2017","","10.1016/j.energy.2017.01.015","wos:000397356400061","2-s2.0-85009950329","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0268015","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Can this still be done if only minimal assumptions are made about any sort of representation of reality? Is there a purely knowledge-based theory of computation that explains the key phenomena which are deemed to be computational in both living and artificial systems as understood today? We argue that this can be done by means of techniques inspired by the modelling of dynamical systems. In this setting, computations are defined as curves in suitable metaspaces and knowledge is generated by virtue of the operation of the underlying mechanism, whatever it is. Desirable properties like compositionality will be shown to fit naturally. The framework also enables one to formally characterize the computational behaviour of both knowledge generation and knowledge recognition. The approach may be used in identifying when processes or systems can be viewed as computational in general. Several further questions pertaining to the philosophy of computing are considered.","","","IN","","inprint   kopie granty všechno evidováno podle udaju na www springer, uvadi tez ISBN 978-3-319-43784-2","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2017","2018","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0267755","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The state of the art solutions in robotics are full state feedback controllers. For human hip-ankle coordination, a more parsimonious and theoretically stable alternative to the robotics solution has been suggested in terms of the Eigenmovement (EM) control. Eigenmovements are kinematic synergies designed to describe the multi DoF system, and its control, with a set of independent, and hence coupling-free, scalar equations. This paper investigates whether the EM alternative shows ‘real-world robustness’ against noisy and inaccurate sensors, mechanical non-linearities such as dead zones, and human-like feedback time delays when controlling hip-ankle movements of a balancing humanoid robot. The EM concept and the EM controller are introduced, the robot’s dynamics are identified using a biomechanical approach, and robot tests are performed in a human posture control laboratory. The tests show that the EM controller provides stable control of the robot with proactive (‘voluntary’) movements and reactive balancing of stance during support surface tilts and translations. Although a preliminary robot-human comparison reveals similarities and differences, we conclude (i) the Eigenmovement concept is a valid candidate when different concepts of human sensorimotor control are considered, and (ii) that human-inspired robot experiments may help to decide in future the choice among the candidates and to improve the design of humanoid robots and robotic rehabilitation devices.","","","JD","","inprint online accepted zkontrolovat úplně všechno, granty, anotace, klíčová slova*** nefunkčníDOI 10.3389/fnbot.2017.00022","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","","2017","2018","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0266230","RVO:67985807","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although his education had been questioned for a long time, he was profoundly educated in botany as well as physics and in those parts of mathematics (combinatorics, probability theory) applied in his later pea plants experiments. Nevertheless, there remain debates in statistical literature about the reasons why are Mendel's results in such a too good accordance with expected values. The main aim of this paper is to propose new two-stage statistical models, which are in a better accordance with Mendel's data than a classical model, where the latter considers a fixed sample size. If Mendel realized his experiments following such two-stage algorithm, which cannot be however proven, the results would purify Mendel's legacy and remove the suspicions that he modified the results. Mendel's experiments are described from a statistical point of view and his data are shown to be close to randomly generated data from the novel models. Such model is found as the most suitable, which is remarkably simpler according to the model of Pires and Branco (2010), while the new model yields only slightly weaker results. The paper also discusses Mendel's legacy from the point of view of biostatistics.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0266126","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Representatives from 72 rehabilitation facilities within 23 European countries completed an online web-based questionnaire survey between 2013 and 2014. Countries were categorised according to four European regions (defined by United Nations Statistics). Similarities and differences between regions were examined. Results: Most participating centres specialized in rehabilitation (82 %) and neurology (60 %), with only 38 % specialising in MS. Of these, the Western based Specialist MS centres were predominately based on outpatient services), whilst the Eastern based European services were mostly inpatient in nature. In almost all participating countries, medical doctors - specialists in neurology (60 %) and in rehabilitation (64 %) - were responsible for referral to/prescription of physiotherapy. Physiotherapists were the most common members of the rehabilitation team; comprising 49 % of the team in Eastern countries compared to approximately 30 % in the rest of Europe. Teamwork was commonly adopted with some differences between Western and Eastern countries. Conclusion: This survey is the first to provide data about organisational aspects of physiotherapy for people with MS across Europe. Overall, care in key organisational aspects of service provision is broadly similar across regions, although some variations, for example the models of teamwork utilised, are apparent. Organisational framework specifics should be considered anytime a multi-centre study is conducted and results from such studies are applied.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","10.1186/s12913-016-1750-6","wos:000384937100001","2-s2.0-84992107992","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0265910","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrary to the least squares, they do not suffer from vulnerability to the presence of outlying measurements in the data. Nevertheless, they need to be accompanied by diagnostic tools for verifying their assumptions. In this paper, we propose the asymptotic Goldfeld-Quandt test for the regression median. It allows to formulate a natural procedure for models with heteroscedastic disturbances, which is again based on the regression median. Further, we pay attention to nonlinear regression model. We focus on the nonlinear least weighted squares estimator, which is one of recently proposed robust estimators of parameters in a nonlinear regression. We study residuals of the estimator and use a numerical simulation to reveal that they can be severely heteroscedastic also for data generated from a model with homoscedastic disturbances. Thus, we give a warning that standard residuals of the robust nonlinear estimator may produce misleading results if used for the standard diagnostic tools","","","BB","","","International Days of Statistics and Economics /10./.

The method has a very good accuracy of 71.5 % when classifying the skill from a single position, and 77.9 % when aggregating predictions from one game. The performance and low amount of information needed allow for a much faster convergence to true rank on online Go servers, improving user experience for new-coming players.

Similarly to the original S-CMA-ES, expensive function evaluations are saved through a surrogate model. However, the model is retrained after the points in which its prediction was most uncertain have been evaluated by the true fitness in each generation. We demonstrate that within small budget of evaluations, the new variant of S-CMA-ES improves the original algorithm and outperforms two state-of-the-art surrogate optimizers, except a few evaluations at the beginning of the optimization process.","","","IN","","","PPSN XIV.

For Ripley, who endorses a nontransitive theory, the best arguments that buttress transitivity also push for contraction - whence it is wiser for the substructural logician to go nontransitive from the start. One of Ripley’s allegations is especially insidious, since it assumes the form of a trivialisation result: it is shown that if a multiset consequence relation can be associated to a closure operator in the expected way, then it necessarily contracts. We counter Ripley’s objection by presenting an approach to multiset consequence that escapes this trap. This approach is multiple-conclusioned in a heterodox way, for multiple succedents are given a conjunctive, rather than a disjunctive reading. Finally, we address a further objection by French and Ripley to the effect that the informational interpretation of sequents in (affine) linear logic does not motivate cut.","","","BA","","inprint online","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2017","2018","","10.1007/s11229-016-1209-7","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0265069","RVO:67985807","1","","","","","","","","","",""

This system will be an expansion of Monoidal t-norm-based logic. First, we introduce an infinitary axiomatic system L, expanding the language with Delta and countably many truth constants, and with only one infinitary inference rule, that is inspired in Takeuti–Titani density rule. Then we show that L is indeed strongly complete with respect to the standard algebra [0,1]*.

Panel data of our interest consist of a moderate or relatively large number of panels, while the panels contain a small number of observations. Testing procedures to detect a possible common change in means of the panels are established. To this end, we consider several competing ratio type test statistics and derive their asymptotic distributions under the no change null hypothesis. Moreover, we prove the consistency of the tests under the alternative. The main advantage of the proposed approaches is that the variance of the observations neither has to be known nor estimated.

At the propositional level, the solver works with some of the best known infinitely-valued fuzzy logics (including BL, Lukasiewicz, Gödel and product logics), and with all the continuous t-norm based logics that can be finitely expressed in terms of the previous ones; concerning the modal expansion, mNiBLoS imposes no boundary on the cardinality of the modal structures considered. The solver allows to test 1-satisfiability of equations, tautologicity and logical consequence problems. The logical language supported extends the usual one of fuzzy modal logics with rational constants and the Monteiro-Baaz delta operator.

While the Syntactic Isomorphism Theorem concerns the relation between the theories of the algebraizable logic L and those of the equational consequence relative to its equivalent algebraic semantics K, the Semantic Isomorphism Theorem describes the interplay between the filters of L on an arbitrary algebra A and the congruences of A relative to K. The pioneering insight of Blok and Jónsson, and the further generalizations by Galatos, Tsinakis, Gil-Férez and Russo, showed that the concept of algebraizability was not intrinsic to the connection between a logic and an equational consequence, thus inaugurating the abstract theory of equivalence between structural closure operators. However all these works focus only on the Syntactic Isomorphism Theorem, disregarding the semantic aspects present in the original theory. In this paper we fill this gap by introducing the notion of compositional lattice, which acts on a category of evaluational frames. In this new framework the non-linguistic flavour of the Semantic Isomorphism Theorem can be naturally recovered. In particular, we solve the problem of finding sufficient and necessary conditions for transferring a purely syntactic equivalence to the semantic level as in the Semantic Isomorphism Theorem.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","10.1016/j.apal.2016.08.001","wos:000385604800006","2-s2.0-84989871444","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0264288","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The fundamental first step is to establish whether or to what extent the interactions between the units can be considered pairwise and, thus, can be modeled as an interaction network with simple links corresponding to pairwise interactions. In principle, this can be determined by comparing the maximum entropy given the bivariate probability distributions to the true joint entropy. In many practical cases, this is not an option since the bivariate distributions needed may not be reliably estimated or the optimization is too computationally expensive. Here we present an approach that allows one to use mutual informations as a proxy for the bivariate probability distributions. This has the advantage of being less computationally expensive and easier to estimate. We achieve this by introducing a novel entropy maximization scheme that is based on conditioning on entropies and mutual informations. This renders our approach typically superior to other methods based on linear approximations. The advantages of the proposed method are documented using oscillator networks and a resting-state human brain network as generic relevant examples.","","","BD","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","10.1103/PhysRevE.94.040301","wos:000388440600002","2-s2.0-84994060943","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0264287","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The Gini index and the entropy principles can be applied in recently proposed similarity measures for objects characterized by values of nominal variables, which can be used e.g. in cluster analysis. The variability measures can be also used for clustering evaluation. From other applications, we can mention the use of the entropy and the Gini index in decision trees for selection of an exploratory variable by means of its categories the values of the target variable can be divided into groups with the smallest entropy or the smallest value of the Gini index.","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0264285","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we consider a Mahalanobis distance suitable for high-dimensional data with the number of variables (largely) exceeding the number of observations. We propose its doubly regularized version, which combines a regularization of the covariance matrix with replacing the means of multivariate data by their regularized counterparts. We formulate explicit expressions for some versions of the regularization of the means, which can be interpreted as a denoising (i.e. robust version) of standard means. Further, we propose a robust cosine similarity measure, which is based on implicit weighting of individual observations. We derive properties of the newly proposed robust cosine similarity, which includes a proof of the high robustness in terms of the breakdown point.","","","BB","","","MME 2016.

The former ones have a physical basis: they utilize discretized differential equations with a set of conditions (boundary conditions + present state as an initial condition) and model the system’s state by integrating the equations forward in time. Models of this type are currently used e.g. as a numerical weather prediction models. The statistical models are considerably different: they are not based on physical mechanisms underlying the dynamics of the modelled system, but rather derived from the analysis of past weather patterns. An example of such a statistical model based on the idea of linear inverse modelling, is examined for modelling the El Nino - Southern Oscillation phenomenon with a focus on modelling cross-scale interactions in the temporal sense. Various noise parameterizations and the possibility of using a multi-variable model is discussed among other characteristics of the statistical model.

Among the compared methods are the Modelassisted CMA-ES, the Robust Kriging Metamodel CMAES, and the Surrogate CMA-ES. In addition, a very successful surrogate-assisted self-adaptive CMA-ES, which is not based on Gaussian processes, but on ordinary regression by means of support vector machines has been included into the comparison. Those methods have been benchmarked using CEC’2013 testing functions. We show that the surrogate CMA-ES achieves best results at the beginning and later phases of optimization process, conceding in the middle to surrogate-assisted CMA-ES.","","","IN","","","ITAT 2016.

In particular in the case of black-box functions, i.e. when no analytical description is available, and the function is evaluated empirically. In such a situation, utilizing information from a surrogate model of the objective function is a well known technique to accelerate the search. In this paper, we review two traditional approaches to surrogate modelling based on Gaussian processes that we have newly reimplemented in MATLAB: Metamodel Assisted Evolution Strategy using probability of improvement and Gaussian Process Optimization Procedure.

The viewer is able to navigate such space depending on author’s predetermined constraints, or even browse the open narrative structure arbitrarily based on their interests. This philosophy is used with great advantage in the collaborative open narrative system NARRA. The platform creates a possibility for documentary makers, journalists, activists or other artists to link their own audiovisual material to clips of other authors and finally create a navigable space of individual multimedia pieces. To help authors focus on building the narratives themselves, a set of automated tools have been proposed. Most obvious ones, as speech-to-text, are already incorporated in the system. However other, more complicated authoring tools, primarily focused on creating metadata for the media objects, are yet to be developed. Most complex of them involve an object description in media (with unrestricted motion, action or other features) and detection of near-duplicates of video content, which is the focus of our current interest. In our approach, we are trying to use motion-based features and register them across the whole clip. Using Grid Cut algorithm to segment the image, we then try to select only parts of the motion picture, that are of our interest for further processing. For the selection of suitable description methods, we are developing a meta-learning approach. This will supposedly enable automatic annotation based not only on clip similarity per se, but rather on detected objects present in the shot.","","","IN","","","ITAT 2016.

Hidden Markov models are considered suitable for clustering purposes. Their clustering is well studied, however, only if the observable variables can be assumed to be Gaussian mixtures, which is not valid in our case. Therefore, we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence to cluster hidden Markov models with observable variables that have an arbitrary distribution. Hierarchical and spectral clustering is applied. To evaluate the modeling approach, an experiment was performed and an accuracy of 83.86% was reached in predicting behavioral sequences of individual animals. Results of clustering were evaluated by means of statistical descriptors of the animals and by a domain expert, both methods confirm that the results of clustering are meaningful.","","","IN","","","ITAT 2016.

The information based on individual attributes is usually aggregated, taken for the most relevant attributes only, or omitted altogether. In this paper, we propose an approach that aligns complete sets of attributes of the datasets, allowing for different number of attributes. By supplying the distance between two attributes, one can find the alignment minimizing the sum of individual distances between aligned attributes. We present two methods that are able to find such an alignment. They differ in computational complexity and presumptions about the distance function between two attributes supplied.

The effect of heat waves was investigated using negative binomial regression in a generalized additive model. We used a linear model on a logarithmic scale, having 1-day lagged temperature differences from the long-term average, 1- day lagged ambient O3 and PM10 concentration, relative humidity, simple ""heat wave"" indicator, and smooth seasonal effect as explanatory variables. We found a small increase in daily mortality for the examined period. This increase can be attributed to PM10 concentrations in most cases, and in fewer instances, to air temperature and O3 concentrations. The ""heat wave"" indicator did not significantly increase the relative risk; the same held for the relative humidity. For the general unstratified population, the highest increase in relative risk of 1.072 (95% CI 1.001-1.147) was observed for cardiovascular mortality and was associated with an increase in temperature of 10 °C, followed by an increase in relative risk of 1.056 (95% CI 1.025-1.087) for respiratory mortality associated with an increase in O3 concentrations by 10 microg^-3. A higher risk in most cases was found for women. A significant increase of relative risk of 1.013 (95 % CI 1.002-1.024) due to PM10 was found for hospital admissions for cardiovascular causes.

Compositional analysis at the home-range scale and location-scale revealed that the snakes used habitats and ecotones non-randomly. Man-made structures were preferred significantly over all other habitat types in both study areas with buildings and their surroundings, stone walls and compost heaps preferred microhabitats in both areas. These sites were used mainly as sheltering places or for thermoregulatory activities. In both areas snakes showed a preference for ecotones, transitional areas between biomes. Urban structures were favoured for nesting and overwintering sites.

The main result of the paper states that as long as the epistemic domain is finite and fixed then intelligent systems with so-called self-improving theories can be designed which soon on later will reach a state of knowledge about the underlying domain which cannot be improved any further.

A concrete construction of a class of functions which cannot be computed by perceptron networks with considerably smaller numbers of units and output weights than the sizes of the function’s domains is presented. In particular, functions on Boolean d-dimensional cubes are constructed which cannot be computed by shallow perceptron networks with numbers of hidden units and sizes of output weights depending on d polynomially.

The present work offers the first (two) steps towards exploring a more general semantical picture, namely a fuzzified version of the classical neighborhood semantics. First we prove the fuzzy version of the classical relationship between Kripke and neighborhood semantics. Second, for any axiomatic extension of MTL (one of the main fuzzy logics), we define its modal expansion by a box-like modality, and, in the presence of some additional conditions, we prove that the resulting logic can be axiomatized by adding the E-rule to the corresponding Hilbert-style calculus of the starting logic.","","","BA","","","IPMU 2016 /16./.

Based on a new score moment method we derive the t-Hill estimator, which estimates the extreme value index of a distribution function with regularly varying tail. t-Hill estimator is distribution sensitive, thus it differs in e.g. Pareto and log-gamma case. Here, we study both forms of the estimator, i.e. t-Hill and t-lgHill. For both estimators we prove weak consistency in moving average settings as well as the asymptotic normality of t-lgHill estimator in iid setting. In cases of contamination with heavier tails than the tail of original sample, t-Hill outperforms several robust tail estimators, especially in small samples. A simulation study emphasizes the fact that the level of contamination is playing a crucial role. The larger the contamination, the better are the t-score moment estimates. The reason for this is the bounded t-score of heavy-tailed distributions (and, consequently, bounded influence functions of the estimators). We illustrate the developed methodology on a small sample data set of stake measurements from Guanaco glacier in Chile.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","10.1007/s10687-016-0256-2","wos:000386530500002","2-s2.0-84976293899","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0260616","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) and fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) are aminopeptidases that regulate several bioactive peptides involved in glucoregulation, and are frequently dysregulated in cancer. The present study analyzes blood plasma levels and the quantity and localization of DPP-IV and FAP in PDAC tissues. Methods: DPP-IV and FAP concentration and enzymatic activity were evaluated in the plasma from 93 PDAC, 39 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 29 control subjects, and in matched paired non-tumorous and tumor tissues from 48 PDAC patients. The localization of DPP-IV and FAP was determined using immunohistochemistry and catalytic histochemistry. Results: The enzymatic activity and concentration of DPP-IV was higher in PDAC tumor tissues compared to non-tumorous pancreas. DPP-IV was expressed in cancer cells and in the fibrotic stroma by activated (myo)fibroblasts including DPP-IV+FAP+ cells. FAP was expressed in stromal cells and in some cancer cells and its expression was increased in the tumors. Plasmatic DPP-IV enzymatic activity, and in particular the ratio between DPP-IV enzymatic activity and concentration in PDAC with recent onset DM was higher compared to T2DM. In contrast, the plasmatic FAP enzymatic activity was lower in PDAC compared to T2DM and controls and rose after tumor removal. Conclusions: DPP-IV-like enzymatic activity is upregulated in PDAC tissues. PDAC patients with recent onset diabetes or prediabetes have increased plasmatic DPP-IV enzymatic activity. These changes may contribute to the frequently observed association of PDAC and recent onset impairment of glucoregulation.","","","FD","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","10.1016/j.pan.2016.06.001","wos:000384785700025","2-s2.0-84991726484","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0260315","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

For instance, data can represent repeated observations of the same individual and suffer from heteroscedasticity as well as other technical snags. The regression analysis of such data is often complicated by the fact that the observations (response variables) are mutually correlated. The correlation structure can be quite complex and might or might not be of direct interest to the user. In any case, one needs to take correlations into account (e.g. by means of random-effect specification) in order to arrive at correct statistical inference (e.g. for construction of the appropriate test or confidence intervals). Over the last decade, such data have been more and more frequently analysed using repeated-measures ANOVA and mixed-effects models. Some researchers invoke the heavy machinery of mixed-effects modelling to obtain the desired population-level (marginal) inference, which can be achieved by using simpler tools - namely marginal models. This paper highlights marginal modelling (using generalized least squares [GLS] regression) as an alternative method. In various concrete situations, such marginal models can be based on fewer assumptions and directly generate estimates (population-level parameters) which are of immediate interest to the behavioural researcher (such as population mean). Sometimes, they might be not only easier to interpret but also easier to specify than their competitors (e.g. mixed-effects models). Using five examples from behavioural research, we demonstrate the use, advantages, limits and pitfalls of marginal and mixed-effects models implemented within the functions of the ‘nlme’ package in R.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","10.1111/eth.12514","wos:000379614900001","2-s2.0-84977675962","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0260312","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The perturbations are arbitrary continuous maps within distance r from f for a given r>0 in the max-norm. The main drawback of the approach is that the computability of well groups was shown only when dim K=n or n=1. Our contribution to the theory of well groups is twofold: on the one hand we improve on the computability issue, but on the other hand we present a range of examples where the well groups are incomplete invariants, that is, fail to capture certain important robust properties of the zero set. For the first part, we identify a computable subgroup of the well group that is obtained by cap product with the pullback of the orientation of R^n by f. In other words, well groups can be algorithmically approximated from below. When f is smooth and dim K < 2n-2, our approximation of the (dim K-n)th well group is exact. For the second part, we find examples of maps f,f’: K -> R^n with all well groups isomorphic but whose perturbations have different zero sets. We discuss on a possible replacement of the well groups of vector valued maps by an invariant of a better descriptive power and computability status.","","","BA","","podpora uvedena na str. 21, jen RVO a grant, nikoli adresa","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","10.1007/s00454-016-9794-2","wos:000377722100005","2-s2.0-84973161597","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0260117","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Various constructions of natural extensions, claimed to be equivalent, may be found in the literature. In particular, these include a syntactic construction due to Shoesmith and Smiley and a related construction due to Lo´s and Suszko. However, it was recently observed by Cintula and Noguera that both of these constructions fail in the sense that they do not necessarily yield a logic. Here we show that whenever the Lo´s–Suszko construction yields a logic, so does the Shoesmith–Smiley construction, but not vice versa. We also describe the smallest and the largest conservative extension of a logic by a set of new variables and show that contrary to some previous claims in the literature, a logic of cardinality K may have more than one conservative extension of cardinality K by a set of new variables. In this connection we then correct a mistake in the formulation of a theorem of Dellunde and Jansana.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","10.1007/s11225-016-9671-2","wos:000387397500005","2-s2.0-84968593308","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0259968","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose a method to assimilate dead fuel moisture content (FMC) observations from remote automated weather stations (RAWS) into a time lag fuel moisture model. RAWS are spatially sparse and a mechanism is needed to estimate fuel moisture content at locations potentially distant from observational stations. This is arranged using a trend surface model (TSM), which allows us to account for the effects of topography and atmospheric state on the spatial variability of FMC. At each location of interest, the TSM provides a pseudo-observation, which is assimilated via Kalman filtering. The method is tested with the time lag fuel moisture model in the coupled weather-fire code WRF–SFIRE on 10-h FMC observations from Colorado RAWS in 2013. Using leave-one-out testing we show that the TSM compares favourably with inverse squared distance interpolation as used in the Wildland Fire Assessment System. Finally, we demonstrate that the data assimilation method is able to improve on FMC estimates in unobserved fuel classes.","","","DG","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","10.1071/WF14085","wos:000375877900006","2-s2.0-84968835226","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0259967","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The photobleaching techniques, mainly FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching), are widely used since 1970’s to determine the mobility of fluorescent molecules within the living cells. While many rather empirical recommendations for the experimental setup have been made in past decades, no rigorous mathematical study concerning optimal design of FRAP experiments exists. In this paper, we formulate and solve the inverse problem of data processing of FRAP images leading to the underlaying model parameter identification. The key concept relies on the analysis of sensitivity of the measured outputs on the model parameters. It permits to represent the resulting parameter estimate as random variable, i.e., we can provide both the mean value and standard error or corresponding confidence interval. Based on the same sensitivity-based approach we further optimize experimental design factors, e.g., the radius of bleach spot. The reliability of our new approach is shown on a numerical example.","","","BA","","","HPCSE 2015. High Performance Computing in Science and Engineering /2./.

Adopting the design of a previous study dealing with vascular plants, we examined whether species richness and composition of bryophyte communities in 23 forest fragments (0.1–255 ha) in a representative upland agricultural landscape in central Bohemia coincides with the same environmental factors as vascular plants and if so, whether congruently or not. According to generalized additive models, bryophyte species richness and composition were significantly related to forest vegetation type, stand basal area and soil pH, analogous to vascular plants. Distribution of human-sensitive bryophyte species was further associated with slope aspect and an unlimited long-range edge effect, shown by increased occurrence of human-sensitive bryophytes along the entire distance gradient from the forest edge (0–477 m). Communities of bryophytes and vascular plants were highly congruent in species richness, species turnover and even in number of species with similar colonization ability. We conclude that requirements of human-sensitive bryophytes are fulfilled only in the core areas of large forest fragments. The small size of most current forest fragments and the range of the edge effect suggest that spatial patterns of bryophyte species composition within forest fragments have been substantially altered in the entire region of central Europe.","","","EH","","","","UEK-B","Ústav výzkumu globální změny v. v. i.","Global change research institute AS CR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","10.1007/s10342-016-0953-z","wos:000379525600010","2-s2.0-84962304765","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0259433","RVO:67179843","0","","","","","","","","","",""

In most of the metalearning approaches, a notion of similarity between datasets is needed. Our approach derives the similarity measure by combining arbitrary attribute similarity functions ordered by the optimal attribute assignment. In this paper, we propose a genetic programming based approach to the evolution of an attribute similarity inducing function. The function is composed of two parts - one describes the similarity of categorical attributes, the other describes the similarity of numerical attributes. Co-evolution is used to put these two parts together to form the similarity function. We use a repairing approach to guarantee some of the metric features for this function, and also discuss which of these features are important in metalearning.","","","IN","","","CEC 2015.

The local search is based on the estimation of hypervolume contribution of each individual and maximization of this contribution. This work extends our previous work and makes such surrogate models applicable to problems with more than two objectives. Moreover, it uses a unique feature of MO-CMA-ES to make the local search more effective. The results indicate that the algorithm can find solutions of the same quality as MO-CMA-ES while using 30-50 percent less objective function evaluations.","","","IN","","","ICTAI 2015.

Since MA can cross both placental and haematoencephalic barriers and is also present in maternal milk, children of chronically abused mothers are exposed prenatally as well as postnatally. Women seem to be more vulnerable to some aspects of MA abuse than men. MA is thought to exert its effects among others via direct interactions with dopamine transporters (DATs) in the brain tissue. Sexual dimorphism of the DAT system could be a base of sex-dependent actions of MA. We examined the striatal synaptosomal DATs in preadolescent male and female Wistar rats exposed prenatally and/or postnatally to MA (daily 5 mg/kg, s.c. to mothers during pregnancy and lactation). To distinguish between specific and nonspecific effects of MA on DATs, we evaluated the in vitro effects of lipophilic MA on the fluidity of striatal membranes isolated from preadolescent and young adult rats. We observed similar changes in the DATs of preadolescent rats exposed prenatally or postnatally. However, prenatal exposure evoked significant changes in males and postnatal exposure in females. A significant decrease in the activity of surface-expressed DATs was found only in postnatally exposed females sensitized to MA via prenatal exposure. MA applied in vitro increased the fluidity of striatal membranes of preadolescent female rats. In summary, DATs of preadolescent males are more sensitive to prenatal MA exposure via changes in the reserve pool and those of preadolescent females to postnatal MA exposure via the same mechanism. The combination of prenatal and postnatal MA exposure increases the risk of dopaminergic deficits via alterations in the activity of surface-expressed DATs especially in preadolescent females. MA-mediated changes in DATs of preadolescent females could be still enhanced via nonspecific disordering actions of MA on striatal membranes.","","","FH","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","10.1007/s11064-016-1902-4","wos:000380716700007","2-s2.0-84961988044","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0258983","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Several spider species have specialized to feed on prey that is highly aggregated, including ants and termites. Ammoxenus (Araneae: Ammoxenidae) are spiders that are specialist predators of harvester termites in southern Africa. Epigeal spiders and termites were sampled by pitfall trapping from six sites in the Erfenis Dam Nature Reserve, South Africa, over a period of one year. We found Ammoxenus amphalodes Dippenaar & Meyer, and two termite species, Hodotermes mossambicus (Hagen) (Isoptera: Hodotermitidae) and Trinervitermes trinervoides (Sjöstedt) (Isoptera: Termitidae) to be abundant there. Our data show that A. amphalodes is a univoltine species with a wide reproductive period corresponding to the seasonal occurrence of termites. The activity density of A. amphalodes was tightly coupled to the activity density of H. mossambicus, but not to that of T. trinervoides.

Two procedures of fitting the estimated point cloudiness to the observed point cloudiness data are proposed and tested. Seven simple effective cloud field models are analyzed. All models underestimate the point cloudiness. The MBE ranges between -0.06 and -0.23 while RMSE between 0.15 and 0.38, depending on the month and the duration of the SSN data averaging interval. The best model is based on a field of clouds of semicircle form. This agrees with previous results obtained in the semi-arid climate of Great South Plains in US. The dynamics of the effective cloud field is reconstructed during all months of 2010 at Timisoara. The time series of effective cloud fields are dominated by semicircle clouds but short episodes of semielliptic clouds, ellipsoid clouds, truncated cone clouds and cuboidal clouds are included in the series.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","10.1016/j.atmosres.2016.03.004","wos:000374625100021","2-s2.0-84962567446","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0258601","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

ANOVA dispersion analysis showed there are 14 areas of the brain where statistically significant changes were registered. Detailed analysis of the activity in these areas before and after training (Student’s and Mann-Whitney tests) showed that the real amount of such areas is five; these are Brodmann areas 44 and 45, insula, middle frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus. We suggest that these changed are caused by the formation of memory traces of those brain activity patterns which are most accurately recognized by BCI classifiers as correspondent with limb movements imagery. We also observed a tendency of increase in the activity of motor imagery after training. The hemodynamic activity in all these 14 areas during real movements was either approximately the same or significantly higher than during motor imagery; activity during imagined leg movements was higher than that during imagines arm movements, except for the areas of representation of arms.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","10.1134/S0362119716010084","","2-s2.0-84961782063","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0258278","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the general concept can be formulated model-free it is often considered in the framework of linear stochastic processes. Here we show how local linear model descriptions can be employed to extend Granger causality into the realm of nonlinear systems. This novel treatment results in maps that resolve Granger causality in regions of state space. Through examples we provide a proof of concept and illustrate the utility of these maps. Moreover, by integration we convert the local Granger causality into a global measure that yields a consistent picture for a global Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

Possibilities for classification to more groups are limited. The aim of this paper is to summarize different measures, discuss their origin and relationships. For classification to three or more groups we propose two novel measures which are more suitable. The first of them takes a variability of diagonal frequencies of the confusion matrix into account.

We discuss the challenges for the development of information-based psychiatry from the point of view of medical informatics together with its specific barriers and constraints. We discuss the development of telemedicine tools for psychiatric care, so far making mainly a disappointing experience. Medical informatics will also play the role in making results of basic research available to the psychiatrist at the point of care. Research results e.g. in molecular genetics or cognitive neuroscience will require to collect and analyze massive data on an individual patient. If these data are properly combined from various sources and analyzed, they represent an enormous potential for bringing a new psychiatric knowledge closer to an individual patient.

This work has the aim to propose new versions of regularized linear discriminant analysis suitable for high-dimensional data contaminated by outliers. We use principles of robust statistics to propose classification methods suitable for data with the number of variables exceeding the number of observations. Particularly, we propose two robust regularized versions of linear discriminant analysis, which have a high breakdown point. For this purpose, we propose a regularized version of the minimum weighted covariance determinant estimator, which is one of highly robust estimators of multivariate location and scatter. It assigns implicit weights to individual observations and represents a unique attempt to combine regularization and high robustness. Algorithms for the efficient computation of the new classification methods are proposed and the performance of these methods is illustrated on real data sets.","","","IN","","","BIOINFORMATICS 2016.

The Ensemble Kalman Filter addresses this problem by estimating the current system state and its uncertainty via their sample counterparts. However, sample covariance matrix based on a small ensemble is not a sufficiently good estimate of the true covariance. In this paper, we deal with techniques relying on transformation of the state to the spectral space and assuming a particular covariance structure based on the Laplace operator. Parameters, which this special structure depends on, are estimated by a least squares method and a maximum likelihood method. The behavior of both estimators is illustrated by a simulation. Both methods have a smaller error in Frobenius norm than the sample covariance, moreover, the latter method performs better than the former one, which corresponds to its stronger assumptions.","","","BB","","","JSM 2015.

The main goal of the contribution is to present the useful methods and efficient algorithms for their solutions. Because the geometry of the system of loaded and possible fractured bones with enlarged neoplasms changes in time, the corresponding mathematical models of tumor’s and cyst’s evolutions lead to the coupled free boundary problems and the dynamic contact problems with or without friction. The discussed parts of these models will be based on the theory of dynamic contact problems without or with Tresca or Coulomb frictions in the visco-elastic rheology. The numerical solution of the problem with Coulomb friction is based on the semi-implicit scheme in time and the finite element method in space, where the Coulomb law of friction at every time level will be approximated by its value from the previous time level. The algorithm for the corresponding model of friction will be based on the discrete mortar formulation of the saddle point problem and the primal-dual active set algorithm. The algorithm for the Coulomb friction model will be based on the fixpoint algorithm, that will be an extension of the PDAS algorithm for the Tresca friction. In this algorithm the friction bound is iteratively modified using the normal component of the Lagrange multiplier. Thus the friction bound and the active and inactive sets are updated in every step of the iterative algorithm and at every time step corresponding to the semi-implicit scheme.","","","BA","","","Applications of Mathematics 2015.

We develop bounds for the extremal singular values of the whole upper J-triangular factor and the whole symplectic factor in terms of the spectral properties of even-dimensioned principal submatrices of the skew-symmetric matrix associated with the SR decomposition.

We were interested in how the self would connect itself to the state of nature portrayed as a threatening problem for which the self is possibly responsible. The participants were divided into two groups based on their environmental profiles and exposed to a video clip which implied a global environmental problem. The study treatment was designed to make the environmental problem salient. We have observed a clear effect of the field of study, yet the sample size (N=77) was not sufficient for the treatment effect to be statistically significant. Our study brings mainly preliminary result and further and more robust research is needed. We observed a slight change in attitudes. The attitudes had divergent directions according to the environmental profile of the recipient. The results suggest that the participants with a low environmental profile more deeply perceived the problem as someone else’s problem and dissociated themselves from the nature framed by the treatment, while the participants with a high environmental profile accepted the problem and associated themselves with the nature framed by the treatment. Our findings are in agreement with the critique of the apocalyptical discursive pattern, which considers planned change of environmental policy with apocalyptical discursive pattern to be ineffective.","","","AN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","","","2-s2.0-84957057127","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0257142","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Research in this area focuses on many-valued logics with linearly ordered truth values and has yielded elegant and deep mathematical theories and challenging problems, thus continuing to attract an ever increasing number of researchers. This handbook provides, through its several volumes, an up-to-date systematic presentation of the best-developed areas of MFL. Its intended audience is researchers working on MFL or related fields, that may use the text as a reference book, and anyone looking for a comprehensive introduction to MFL. This handbook will be useful not only for readers interested in pure mathematical logic, but also for those interested in logical foundations of fuzzy set theory or in a mathematical apparatus suitable for dealing with some philosophical and linguistic issues related to vagueness. This third volume starts with three chapters on semantics of fuzzy logics, namely, on the structure of linearly ordered algebras, on semantic games, and on Ulam–Rényi games; it continues with an introduction to fuzzy logics with evaluated syntax, a survey of fuzzy description logics, and a study of probability on MV-algebras; and it ends with a philosophical chapter on the role of fuzzy logics in theories of vagueness.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0256924","RVO:67985807","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the association between short-term elevations of air pollutant concentrations and worsening of respiratory problems, use of asthma medication and restriction of daily activities in asthmatic patients in Ostrava. Methods: One-hundred and forty-seven child and adolescent patients (aged 6–18 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of mild to moderate persistent asthma were included in the study. Participants' parents completed diaries covering the period of November 2013 to February 2014; this analysis included 18,228 person-days. Daily smoothed maps of outdoor concentrations of particulate matter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) were constructed from routine monitoring data, and participants' daily exposures were estimated on the basis of time spent at home and at school. The associations between health outcomes and exposure to air pollutants were estimated using the multiple logistic regression method. Results: The odds ratios (OR) of the combined outcome for wheezing and/or difficulty in breathing, per 10 µg/m3 increase in the mean 24-h exposure were 1.07 (95% confidence interval 1.04–1.11) for PM10, 1.30 (1.18–1.44) for NO2, and 1.37 (1.18–1.59) for SO2. Additional inhaler use (in addition to usual medication) was also more frequent at higher air pollutant concentrations; the odds ratios per 10 µg/m3; increase in the mean 24-h exposure were 1.05 (1.02–1.07) for PM10, 1.19 (1.10–1.30) for NO2, and 1.26 (1.11–1.43) for SO2. Associations were less consistent for other health outcomes. Conclusions: These results suggest moderately strong associations between air pollutant concentrations and respiratory difficulties among asthmatic children and adolescents. More detailed analyses are required to confirm these preliminary findings.","","","DN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","","wos:000370311200003","2-s2.0-84958177889","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0256795","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The project deals with the adaptation of cities on changing climatic conditions. The main project objective is to start the process of preparation of cities’ adaptation strategies, developing adaptation scenarios and testing the effects and benefits of particular measures. Project team involves groups from different fields that cover various aspects of adaptation measures including economic analyses, policy making processes, education and dissemination to the public. The presented paper deals with the part of activities which are focused on modelling of adaptation measures and climatic impacts for the city of Prague. These activities include assessment of energy balance of city, in terms of interactions of solar radiation, atmosphere and urban environment. Urban environment includes not only buildings, street surfaces and vegetation, but also the processes having impact on energy balance such as the traffic, air conditioning and industry that produce anthropogenic heat which can play a role for example in summer heat waves. The ultimate goal is to assess the impact of different adaptation measures on citizens who live in environmental conditions of growing effect of urban heat island. Thus the connection between objective meteorological variables and subjective biological indices has to be investigated. The concept of Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) is adopted. In comparison to single values of air temperature, air humidity, global horizontal irradiance, wind speed, and other meteorological indexes, concept of PET has added value in determining the value of important biometeorological index in easily recognizable quantity such as °C. Micro-scale models can be one way to study proposed adaptation measures such as tree alleys, bodies of water, etc.","","","DG","","","SCSP 2015. Smart Cities Symposium Prague.

Climate oscillations with the period about 7-8 years have been observed in many instrumental records in Europe. Although these oscillations are weak if considering their amplitude, they might have nonnegligible influence on temperature variability on shorter time scales due to cross-scale interactions recently observed by Paluš (2014). In order to quantify the cross-scale influence, we propose a simple conditional mean approach which estimates the effect of the cycle with the period close to 8 years on the amplitude of the annual cycle in surface air temperature (SAT) in the range 0.7-1.4°C and the effect on the overall variability of the SAT anomalies (SATA) leads to the changes 1.5-1.7°C in the annual SATA means.

This paper is devoted to robust regression and presents three contributions to its diagnostic tools or estimating regression parameters under non-standard conditions. Firstly, we derive the Durbin-Watson test of independence of random regression errors for the regression median. The approach is based on the approximation to the exact null distribution of the test statistic. Secondly, we accompany the least trimmed squares estimator by a subjective criterion for selecting a suitable value of the trimming constant. Thirdly, we propose a robust version of the instrumental variables estimator.

Seventeen patients had undergone previous surgery, in nine patients LGK irradiation was the primary therapy. Furthermore, 14 patients with Nelson's syndrome were followed-up for 30-204 months (median 144 months). LGK treatment resulted in hormonal normalization in 80.7 % of patients with Cushing's disease. Time to normalization was 6-54 months (median 30 months). The volume of the adenoma decreased in 92.3 % (in 30.7 % disappeared completely). There was no recurrence of the disease. In all 14 patients with Nelson's syndrome ACTH levels decreased (in two patients fully normalized) their ACTH levels. When checked up 5-10 years after irradiation regrowth of the adenoma was only detected in one patient (9.1 %), in 27.3 % adenoma volume remained unchanged, in 45.4 % adenoma volume decreased and in 18.2 % adenoma completely disappeared. Hypopituitarism did not develop in any patient where the critical dose to the pituitary and distal infundibulum was respected. LGK radiation represents an effective and well-tolerated option for the treatment of patients with Cushing's disease after unsuccessful surgery and may be valuable even as a primary treatment in patients who are not suitable for, or refuse, surgery. In the case of Nelson's syndrome it is possible to impede tumorous growth and control the size of the adenoma in almost all patients.","","","FB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.1007/s11102-014-0584-7","wos:000354205000013","2-s2.0-84930928134","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0256614","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed strategy is based on adaptive dropping that reflects the quality of preserving the relation $UZ = I$ between the direct factor $U$ and the inverse factor $Z$ satisfying $A = U^TU$ and $A^{-1}=ZZ^T$. An important part of the approach is column pivoting, used to minimize the growth of the condition number of leading principal submatrices of $U$ that occurs explicitly in the dropping criterion. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the resulting approximate inverse factorization is robust as a preconditioner for solving large and sparse systems of linear equations.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","10.1137/15M1030315","wos:000385282800024","2-s2.0-84976871009","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0256585","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the most popular classes of copulas is the class of hierarchical Archimedean copulas, which gained its popularity due to the fact that the models from the class are able to model the stochastic dependencies conveniently even in high dimensions. One critical issue when estimating a hierarchical Archimedean copula is to correctly determine its structure. The paper describes an approach to the problem of the structure determination of a hierarchical Archimedean copula, which is based on the close relationship of the copula structure and the values of measure of concordance computed on all its bivariate margins. The presented approach is conveniently summarized as a simple algorithm.","","","IN","","je tam Inovace studijn´ıch program˚u na Slezsk´e univerzitˇe, Obchodnˇe podnikatelsk´e fakultˇe v Karvin´e, Reg. ˇc.

Traditionally, similarity measures have been constructed manually, and thus could not precisely grasp the complex relationship among the different features of the datasets. Recently, we have used an attribute alignment technique combined with genetic programming to obtain more fine-grained and trainable dataset similarity measure. In this paper, we propose an approach based on multiobjective genetic programming for evolving an attribute similarity function. Multi-objective optimization is used to encourage some of the metric properties, thus contributing to the generalization abilities of the similarity function being evolved. Experiments are performed on the data extracted from the OpenML repository and their results are compared to a baseline algorithm.","","","IN","","ISBNna clanku a printisbn je 978-1-4799-7560-0","SSCI 2015.

However, the creation of ensembles is a tedious task which requires a lot of human interaction and experimentation. In this paper, we present a technique for construction of ensembles based on typed genetic programming. The technique describes an ensemble as a directed acyclic graph, which is internally represented as a tree evolved by the genetic programming.

We formulate a sequent calculus for this logic and introduce the variety of reductio algebras as an algebraic semantics for this calculus. We then investigate some basic algebraic properties of this variety, in particular we show that it is locally finite and has EDPC.

Such decompositions\\nare utilized directly in Boolean factor analysis or indirectly as a\\ndimensionality reduction method for Boolean data in machine learning.\\nWhile some comparison of the BMF methods with matrix decomposition\\nmethods designed for real valued data exists in the literature, a mutual\\ncomparison of the various BMF methods is a severely neglected topic. In\\nthis paper, we compare the four methods on real datasets. In particular,\\nwe observe the reconstruction ability of the first few computed factors as\\nwell as the number of computed factors necessary to fully reconstruct the\\ninput matrix, i.e. the approximation to the Boolean rank of I computed\\nby the methods.

The perturbations are arbitrary continuous maps within L_infty distance r from f for a given r > 0. The main drawback of the approach is that the computability of well groups was shown only when dim K = n or n = 1. Our contribution to the theory of well groups is twofold: on the one hand we improve on the computability issue, but on the other hand we present a range of examples where the well groups are incomplete invariants, that is, fail to capture certain important robust properties of the zero set. For the first part, we identify a computable subgroup of the well group that is obtained by cap product with the pullback of the orientation of R^n by f. In other words, well groups can be algorithmically approximated from below. When f is smooth and dim K < 2n-2, our approximation of the (dim K-n)th well group is exact. For the second part, we find examples of maps f, f' from K to R^n with all well groups isomorphic but whose perturbations have different zero sets. We discuss on a possible replacement of the well groups of vector valued maps by an invariant of a better descriptive power and computability status.","","","IN","","","SoCG 2015.

We investigate the minimal degree of firing of rules in the rule base when moving across the input space. This minimal degree is called the degree of coverage (DOC) and refers to the area of the input space where the rule base has the weakest explanatory power. Identification of the DOC corresponds to a constrained optimization problem. Whilst in general case solving this problem may be hard, in the radial fuzzy systems it may be eased by passing to convex optimization, however, at the cost of getting only a lower bound on the DOC. Moreover, we introduce an algorithm to check out different lower bounds on the DOC for the case of the specific radial rule bases.","","","IN","","ISBN 978-1-4673-7247-3 je na copyrightpage, nebo 978-1-4673-7248-0 je na clanku nebo Weitere Ausgaben: 978-1-4673-7249-7 (Printausgabe)","NAFIPS 2015.

The interpretation of acquired knowledge is, however, generally difficult because the knowledge is encoded into values of the parameters of the network. Contrary to neural networks, fuzzy systems allow a more convenient interpretation of the stored knowledge in the form of IF-THEN rules. This paper contributes to the fusion of these two concepts. Namely, we show that a RBF neural network can be interpreted as the radial fuzzy system. The proposed approach is based on the study of conjunctive and implicative representations of the rule base in radial fuzzy systems. We present conditions under which both representations are computationally close and, as the consequence, a reasonable syntactic interpretation of RBF neural networks can be introduced.","","","IN","","","EANN 2015.

Mobile source BC emission controls, mostly on diesel-burning vehicles, have successfully decreased mobile source BC emissions to less than half of what they were 30 years ago. Quantification of the benefits of previous emissions controls conveys the value of these regulatory actions and provides a method by which future control alternatives could be evaluated. In this study we use the adjoint of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to estimate highly-resolved spatial distributions of benefits related to emission reductions for six urban regions within the continental US. Emissions from outside each of the six chosen regions account for between7%and 27% of the premature deaths attributed to exposure to BC within the region. While we estimate that nonroad mobile and onroad diesel emissions account for the largest number of premature deaths attributable to exposure to BC, onroad gasoline is shown to have more than double the benefit per unit emission relative to that of nonroad mobile and onroad diesel. Within the region encompassing New York City and Philadelphia, reductions in emissions from large industrial combustion sources that are not classified as EGUs (i.e., non-EGU) are estimated to have up to triple the benefits per unit emission relative to reductions to onroad diesel sectors, and provide similar benefits per unit emission to that of onroad gasoline emissions in the region. While onroad mobile emissions have been decreasing in the past 30 years and a majority of vehicle emission controls that regulatePMfocus on diesel emissions, our analysis shows the most efficient target for stricter controls is actually onroad gasoline emissions.","","","DG","Supplementary material for this article is available online","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.1088/1748-9326/10/11/114014","wos:000367249900018","2-s2.0-84949239046","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0253967","RVO:67985807","1","","","","","","","","","",""

Je zdánlivým paradoxem, že najít konkrétní příklad takové funkce je obtížné. Možným vysvětlením je, že jak reálné úlohy modelované neuronovými sítěmi, tak funkce popsané matematickými formulemi patří do malé množiny funkcí, které mají strukturu, která se dá realizovat neuronovými sítěmi přijatelných velikostí.

This paper has the aim to propose and investigate specific approaches for two situations. First, we consider clustering of categorical data. While attention has been paid to sensitivity of standard statistical and data mining methods for categorical data only recently, we aim at modifying standard distance measures between clusters of such data. This allows us to propose a hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis for two-way contingency tables with a large number of categories, based on a regularized measure of distance between two contingency tables. Such proposal improves the robustness to the presence of measurement errors for categorical data. As a second problem, we investigate the nonlinear version of the least weighted squares regression for data with a continuous response. Our aim is to propose an efficient algorithm for the least weighted squares estimator, which is formulated in a general way applicable to both linear and nonlinear regression. Our numerical study reveals the computational aspects of the algorithm and brings arguments in favor of its credibility.","","","BB","","","International Days of Statistics and Economics /9./.

Even though this fragment is undecidable, we prove that - under the additional assumption of bounded domains-there is a (possibly non-terminating) algorithm for checking satisfiability such that (1) whenever it terminates, it computes a correct answer, and (2) it always terminates when the input is robust. A formula is robust, if its satisfiability does not change under small continuous perturbations. We also prove that it is not possible to generalize this result to the full first-order language - removing the restriction on the number of equations versus number of variables.

Here a data-driven approach is introduced based on a dimension reduction, causal reconstruction, and novel network measures based on causal effect theory that go beyond standard complex network tools by distinguishing direct from indirect pathways. Applied to a data set of atmospheric dynamics, the method identifies several strongly uplifting regions acting as major gateways of perturbations spreading in the atmosphere. Additionally, the method provides a stricter statistical approach to pathways of atmospheric teleconnections, yielding insights into the Pacific–Indian Ocean interaction relevant for monsoonal dynamics. Also for neuroscience or power grids, the novel causal interaction perspective provides a complementary approach to simulations or experiments for understanding the functioning of complex spatio-temporal systems with potential applications in increasing their resilience to shocks or extreme events.","","","DG","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.1038/ncomms9502","wos:000364929000004","2-s2.0-84943609055","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0250739","RVO:67985807","1","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the study reported here was to determine whether fear of such a withdrawal could lead to patients concealing severe hypoglycemia from physicians, which could negatively impact further treatment decisions. Methods: A total of 663 patients with insulin-treated diabetes were anonymously surveyed about whether they would conceal severe hypoglycemic events from their physicians, if revealing them could result in driving license withdrawal. This investigation utilized an adapted and expanded questionnaire by Graveling et al. Results: Of all diabetic patients surveyed, 26.17% would most likely not report hypoglycemia, and 25.86% were undecided. In a group of patients with type 1 diabetes, 31.83% would likely not report hypoglycemic events, and 25.06% were undecided. The patients least likely to report severe hypoglycemic events were those who indicated that vehicles were partly essential for work, and who also had more than two hypoglycemic events monthly. Conclusion: A considerable percentage of diabetic patients would likely conceal severe hypoglycemic events from their physicians due to fear of driving license withdrawal. Patient failure to report severe hypoglycemic events can potentially lead to physicians being misinformed regarding the patient’s condition, which could lead to inadequate monitoring and treatment.","","","FB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.2147/PPA.S87393","wos:000362296700001","2-s2.0-84942780763","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0250715","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

By a Rees coextension of a negative tomonoid S, we mean a negative tomonoid T such that a Rees quotient of T is isomorphic to S. We characterize the set of all those Rees coextensions of a finite, negative tomonoid that are by one element larger.

Via a reverse reduction, we prove that the problem is undecidable when dim K >= 2n-2, where the threshold comes from the stable range in homotopy theory. For the lucidity of our exposition, we focus on the setting when f is simplexwise linear.

Such functions can be evaluated only empirically, usually through some costly or time-consuming measurement, numerical simulation or experimental testing. Therefore, an important direction of research is the approximation of these objective functions with a suitable regression model, also called surrogate model of the objective functions. This paper evaluates two different approaches to the continuous black-box optimization which both integrates surrogate models with the state-of-the-art optimizer CMAES. The first Ranking SVM surrogate model estimates the ordering of the sampled points as the CMA-ES utilizes only the ranking of the fitness values. However, we show that continuous Gaussian processes model provides in the early states of the optimization comparable results.","","","IN","","","ITAT 2015.

Gaussian processes (GPs) are one of the approaches suggested to this end, already nearly 20 years ago, in the area of general global optimization. So far, however, they received only little attention in the area of evolutionary black-box optimization. This work investigates the performance of GPs in the context of black-box continuous optimization, using multimodal functions from the CEC 2013 competition. It shows the performance of two methods based on GPs, Model Guided Sampling Optimization (MGSO) and GPs as a surrogate model for CMA-ES. The paper compares the speed-up of both methods with respect to the number of function evaluations using different settings to CMAES with no surrogate model.","","","IN","","","ITAT 2015.

In this case study, we propose a method for structure discovery in recorded lectures. The method consists in integrating a self-organizing map (SOM) and hierarchical clustering to find a suitable cluster structure of the lectures. The output of every SOM is evaluated by various levels of hierarchical clustering with different number of clusters mapped to the SOM. Within these mapped levels we search for the one with the lowest average within-cluster distance, which we consider the most appropriate number of clusters for the map. In experiments, we applied the proposed approach, with SOMs of four different sizes, to nearly 16 000 slides extracted from the recorded lectures.","","","IN","","","ITAT 2015.

Consequently, a considerable amount of anomaly detection algorithms was proposed in the last few years. Only a few papers about anomaly detection at least mentioned why some samples were labelled as anomalous. Therefore, we proposed a method allowing to extract rules explaining the anomaly from an ensemble of specifically trained decision trees, called sapling random forest. Our method is able to interpret the output of an arbitrary anomaly detector. The explanation is given as conjunctions of atomic conditions, which can be viewed as antecedents of association rules. In this work we focus on selection, post processing and evaluation of those rules. The main goal is to present a small number of the most important rules. To achieve this, we use quality measures such as lift and confidence boost. The resulting sets of rules are experimentally and empirically evaluated on two artificial datasets and one real-world dataset.","","","IN","","","ITAT 2015.

For that comparison, we have chosen regression methods that have been used as surrogate models in such optimization: radial basis function networks, Gaussian processes, and random forests. Because the purpose of black-box optimization is frequently some kind of design of experiments, and because a role similar to surrogate models is in the traditional design of experiments played by response surface models, we also include standard response surface models, i.e., polynomial regression.

Combination of conflicting belief functions and interpretation of conflicts is often questionable in real applications, thus a series of alternative combination rules was suggested and a series of papers on conflicting belief functions published in last years. This theoretical contribution presents one of the perspective recent approaches - author’s plausibility conflict - and Harmanec’s approach which stands, unfortunately, aside the recent interest: conflict based on uncertainty measure and Dempster’s rule. Both the approaches are analysed and compared here. The compared approaches are based on completely different assumptions, thus some of their properties are very different almost counterintuitive when first look at; on the other hand, they have some analogous properties, which distinguish them from other commonly used approaches to conflict between belief functions.","","","BA","","","ECSQARU 2015.

Soubor a metodika: Dvanáct nemocných s roztroušenou sklerózou (průměrný věk 44,3 +/- 9,2 let, EDSS 3,7 +/- 0,9, délky onemocnění 9,3 +/- 6,0 let) podstoupilo dvouměsíční fyzioterapii –  Motorické programy aktivující terapii. Na začátku a na konci facilitačního fyzioterapeutického programu (2× týdně, 1 hod) bylo provedeno klinické vyšetření zaměřené na funkci horních končetin (hodnocení třesu, diadochokinézy, taxe, kvalitativní svalové síly a spasticity) a vyšetření funkční magnetickou rezonancí během motorické úlohy prstů. Z dat funkční rezonance byly analýzou v programu Statistical parametric mapping určeny síly efektivní konektivity mezi suplementární motorickou areou a primárními motorickými oblastmi. Kontrolní skupinu tvořilo 12 zdravých dobrovolníků (průměrný věk 39,4 +/- 12,2 let). Výsledky: Analýza efektivní konektivity ukázala silné spojení mezi suplementární motorickou areou a oběma primárními motorickými oblastmi (pacienti měli většinou silnější konektivitu než zdravé kontroly, významně mezi suplementární motorickou areou a primární motorickou oblastí vlevo; p = 0,005). Efektivní konektivita mezi levou a pravou primární motorickou oblastí byla celkově významně slabší. Po terapii došlo u nemocných ke zlepšení ve všech klinických testech (v indexu pravé ruky p < 0,001, v indexu levé ruky p < 0,001), nebyly ale prokázány signifikantní změny efektivní konektivity. Závěr: Analýza efektivní konektivity je jedna z cest k objektivizaci mozkové plasticity, a to nejenom z anatomického, ale především z funkčního hlediska. Terapie měla jednoznačný pozitivní vliv na klinické funkce, avšak signifikantní změny efektivní konektivity po terapii se neprokázaly.","Aim: The aim was to objectify neuroplasticity after physiotherapy using an innovative method of functional magnetic resonance imaging data analysis (determination of effective connectivity) in multiple sclerosis patients. Material and methods: Twelve patients (mean: age 44.3 +/- 9.2 years, EDSS 3.7 +/- 0.9, disease duration 9.3 +/- 6.0 years underwent Motor program activation therapy (one hour therapy, twice a week). Clinical and fMRI examination during a motoric task for fingers was carried out before and after the therapy. The clinical examination focused on the upper extremity function (evaluation of tremor, diadochokinesis, ataxia, muscle strength and spasticity). Effective connectivity between supplementary motor and right and left primary motor areas was determined using the Statistical Parametric Mapping software. A control group consisted of 12 healthy controls (mean age 39.4 +/- 12.2). Results: The analysis of effective connectivity showed strong connection between the supplementary motor area and both primary motor areas (patients had stronger connection in more cases than healthy controls, significant between the supplementary motor area and the left primary motor area, p = 0.005). Effective connectivity between the right and left primary motor areas was significantly weaker. After the therapy, improvement occurred in all the clinical tests (right hand index p < 0.001, left hand index p < 0.001) but no changes were observed in effective connectivity. Conclusion: Effective connectivity represents a possible approach to objectification of brain plasticity. Facilitation physiotherapy had a significant effect on clinical function while significant changes of effective connectivity were not demonstrated.","","FH","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.14735/amcsnn2015423","wos:000359037900006","2-s2.0-84940527325","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0249630","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

It appears that 17 beta-HSD10 may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. Objective: We investigated the possibility that levels of 17 beta-HSD10 in cerebrospinal fluid could be a prospective biomarker of AD. Methods: We estimated the enzyme levels in 161 people (15 non-demented controls, 52 people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 35 people with probable AD, or 59 people with other types of dementia) and compared them with those of A beta(1-42), tau, and phospho-tau. Results: We found significantly higher levels of 17 beta-HSD10 in people with MCI due to AD (to 109.9%), with AD (to 120.0%), or with other types of dementia (to 110.9%) when compared to the control group. The sensitivity of the new biomarker to AD was 80.0%, and the specificity was 73.3% (compared to controls) or 52.5-59.1% (compared to other types of dementia). Results of multiple linear regression and of correlation analysis revealed AD-mediated changes in links between 17 beta-HSD10 and Mini Mental State Examination score. Conclusion: It seems that changes in 17 beta-HSD10 start many years before symptom onset, analogous to those in A beta(1-42), tau, or phospho-tau and that the levels are a relatively highly sensitive but unfortunately less specific biomarker of AD. A role of 17 beta-HSD10 overexpression in AD is discussed.","","","FH","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.3233/JAD-142898","wos:000360931700010","2-s2.0-84940995512","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0249606","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Fitting copulas to multidimensional data is an increasingly important method for analyzing dependencies, and the proposed quantifiers of observational calculus assess the results of estimating the structure of joint distributions of continuous variables by means of hierarchical Archimedean copulas. To this end, the existing theory of hierarchical Archimedean copulas has been slightly extended in the paper: It has been proven that sufficient conditions for the function defining a hierarchical Archimedean copula to be indeed a copula, which have so far been rigorously established only for the special case of fully nested Archimedean copulas, hold in general. These conditions allow us to define three new generalized quantifiers, which are then thoroughly validated on four benchmark data sets and one data set from a real-world application. The paper concludes by comparing the proposed quantifiers to a more traditional approach—maximum weight spanning trees.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.1109/TKDE.2015.2426705","wos:000361245300020","2-s2.0-84941569975","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0249603","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The method is extended by wavelets to the case when the state variables are random fields which are not spatially homogeneous. Efficient implementations by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) are presented for several types of observations, including high-dimensional data given on a part of the domain, such as radar and satellite images.

Rather than considering the creativity  process in its full generality, we restrict ourselves to so-called epistemic creativity which deals with the processes that create knowledge. Within this domain we mainly concentrate on elementary acts  of creativity - viz. drawing analogies. In order to do so using the epistemic framework, we define analogies as certain relationships among linguistic expressions and we state what knowledge must be discovered in order to resolve a given incompletely specified analogy. We assume analogies are formed in a natural language and also require that a solution of each analogy must contain an explanation why the resulting analogy holds. Finally, the difference between noncreative and creative computational processes is discussed. Our approach differs from the majority of previous approaches in stressing the knowledge discovery aspects of computational creativity, in requiring explanations in analogy solving and, last but not least, in including theory-less domains serving as knowledge base for knowledge discovery process.","","","IN","","","AISB Symposium on Computing and Philosophy: The Significance of Metaphor and Other Figurative Modes of Expression and Thought /8./.

Their advantage is that they can be easily understood by stakeholders and domain experts. However, since use-cases typically rely on natural language, they cannot be directly subject to a formal verification. In this article, we present a method (called Formal Verification of Annotated Use-Case Models, FOAM) for formal verification of use-cases. This method features simple user-definable annotations, which are inserted into a use-case to make its semantics more suitable for verification. Subsequently, a model-checking tool is employed to verify temporal invariants associated with the annotations. This way, FOAM allows harnessing the benefits of model checking while still keeping the use-cases understandable for non-experts.","","","JC","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.1093/comjnl/bxu068","wos:000359141100001","2-s2.0-84937053805","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0248549","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

C. Paige and Z. Strakoš, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 27 (2005), pp. 861-875] separates necessary and sufficient information for solving the problem from redundancies and irrelevant information contained in the data. It is based on orthogonal transformations such that the resulting problem decomposes into two independent parts. One of the parts has nonzero right-hand side and minimal dimensions and it always has the unique TLS solution. The other part has trivial (zero) right-hand side and maximal dimensions. Assuming exact arithmetic, the core problem can be obtained by the Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization. Extension of the core concept to the multiple right-hand sides case $AX/approx B$ in [I.

These catchments are often up to 50 km2 in area, their character is torrential, and the type of water flow is super-critical. Many of them are ungauged. The damage in the catchments is enormous, and the length of the torrents is about 23% of the total length of small rivers in the Czech Republic. The Smědá experimental mountainous catchment (with the Bílý potok downstream gauge) in the Jizerské hory Mts. was chosen as a model area for simulating extreme rainfall-runoff processes using two different models. For the purposes of evaluating and simulating significant rainfall-runoff episodes, we chose the KINFIL physically-based 2D hydrological model, and ANN, an artificial neural network mathematical “learning” model. A neural network is a model of the non-linear functional dependence between inputs and outputs with free parameters (weights), which are created by iterative gradient learning algorithms utilizing calibration data. The two models are entirely different. They are based on different principles, but both require the same time series (rainfall-runoff ) data. However, the parameters of the models are fully different, without any physical comparison. The strength of KINFIL is that there are physically clear parameters corresponding to adequate hydrological process equations, while the strength of ANN lies in the “learning procedure”. Their common property is the rule that the greater the number of measured rainfall-runoff events (pairs), the better fitted the simulation results can be expected.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.17221/16/2015-SWR","wos:000359331100001","2-s2.0-84937836541","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0248525","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we introduce a separation algorithm of a neural network with switching  units (NNSU), and present its applicability to processing selected MonteCarlo (MC) data channels of the LHC detector in CERN Geneve and selected MC data of DO-detector in FNAL. The result achieved by this algorithm provides better separation of signal and background events than classical cut-based methods and the separation result is comparable to TMVA ROOT methods, such as BDT and MLP. The training phase of NNSU uses a genetic optimization of NNSU architecture, hence a convenient definition of corresponding fitness function allows for refinement of separation results to meet user defined requirements. In the next parts we discuss the possibility of efficient hardware implementation. NNSU algorithm is in fact a piecewise linear discrimination and, therefore, testing phase of the algorithm can be performed by hardware means. First step toward hardware implementation was done, and possibility of full electronic implementation was studied. On the base of this study we estimate that event processing speed about 25 mega-samples per second is reachable by full hardware implementation without significant degradation of separation quality.","","","IN","","isbn 978-1-4799-3658-8 je u článku *** isbn na front cover a ve scopus je 978-1-4799-3659-5, patrně nestránkováno - Article number 7097405. volím podle KVK online + 978-1-4799-3659-5","RT 2014.

Here we present an alternative approach using the adjoint of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, which provides source–receptor relationships at highly resolved sectoral, spatial, and temporal scales. While damage resulting from anthropogenic emissions of BC is strongly correlated with population and premature death, we found little correlation between damage and emission magnitude, suggesting that controls on the largest emissions may not be the most efficient means of reducing damage resulting from anthropogenic BC emissions. Rather, the best proxy for locations with damaging BC emissions is locations where premature deaths occur. Onroad diesel and nonroad vehicle emissions are the largest contributors to premature deaths attributed to exposure to BC, while onroad gasoline emissions cause the highest deaths per amount emitted. Emissions in fall and winter contribute to more premature deaths (and more per amount emitted) than emissions in spring and summer. Overall, these results show the value of the high-resolution source attribution for determining the locations, seasons, and sectors for which BC emission controls have the most effective health benefits.","","","DG","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.1021/es505968b","wos:000352659000043","2-s2.0-84926443124","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0247992","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The most usual method is the Tikhonov regularization. Nevertheless, in our specific problem we have detected difficulties residing in determination of the optimal regularization parameter alpha. Hence, an equivalent method based on least squares with a quadratic constraint regularization is proposed. This latter approach naturally takes into account the noise level in the data and corresponds to Morozov’s discrepancy principle as well. The equivalence of both methods is rigorously proven and on a simple numerical example with synthetic input data practically documented.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.1016/j.cam.2015.05.028","wos:000359167100044","2-s2.0-84936773896","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0247781","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

An important problem of the EEG-based BCI system consists in designing the EEG pattern classifier. The selection of the EEG channels used for building that learning predictor has impact in the classifier performance. We present results of both metaheuristic techniques on real data set when the classifier is a Bayesian predictor. We statistically compare that performances with a random selection of the EEG channels. According our empirical results our approach significantly increases the accuracy of the learning predictor.","","","IN","","granty v originale uvedeny jako CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0070 a CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0055 *** ve scopus též jako 84958535773","ICAISC 2015.

Therefore, dimensionality reduction represents a common and important step in the analysis of multivariate data by methods of both statistics and data mining. This paper gives an overview of robust dimensionality procedures, which are resistant against the presence of outlying measurements. A simulation study represents the main contribution of the paper. It compares various standard and robust dimensionality procedures in combination with standard and robust methods of classification analysis. While standard methods turn out not to perform too badly on data which are only slightly contaminated by outliers, we give practical recommendations concerning the choice of a suitable robust dimensionality reduction method for highly contaminated data. Namely the highly robust principal component analysis based on the projection pursuit approach turns out to yield the most satisfactory results over four different simulation studies. At the same time, we give recommendations on the choice of a suitable robust classification method.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.5937/sjm10-6531","","2-s2.0-84927920065","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0247235","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Various available versions of the MRMR approach have been designed to search for variables with the largest relevance for a classification task while controlling for redundancy of the selected set of variables. However, usual relevance and redundancy criteria have the disadvantages of being too sensitive to the presence of outlying measurements and/or being inefficient. We propose a novel approach called Minimum Regularized Redundancy Maximum Robust Relevance (MRRMRR), suitable for noisy high-dimensional data observed in two groups. It combines principles of regularization and robust statistics. Particularly, redundancy is measured by a new regularized version of the coefficient of multiple correlation and relevance is measured by a highly robust correlation coefficient based on the least weighted squares regression with data-adaptive weights. We compare various dimensionality reduction methods on three real data sets. To investigate the influence of noise or outliers on the data, we perform the computations also for data artificially contaminated by severe noise of various forms. The experimental results confirm the robustness of the method with respect to outliers.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.1155/2015/320385","wos:000356261700001","2-s2.0-84934967829","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0247234","RVO:67985807","1","","","","","","","","","",""

For statistical analysis, we used linear mixed effect model (LME) with carefully parametrized size-dependent coefficients describing dependence of cryptogams on live or dead wood volumes.

It is critical to understand differences in growth interpretation and potential consequences when using available growth references. This study compares the growth of Czech breastfed children with the current WHO growth standards 2006 and the Czech references 1991, 2001. A total of 960 infant/parent pairs in the Czech Republic were recruited through paediatric practices. Anthropometric data were collected during infants' first 12 months of life and parent questionnaires were gathered during a preventive visit at 18 months. Czech breastfed infants were longer with a greater head circumference at all percentiles compared to the WHO standards and were similar to the national references. The percentile weight-for-age and weight-for-length values of infants (56 months) were lower, and higher (6-12 months) compared to the WHO standards. The infant growth in the sample differed from both the WHO standards as well as the national references. Our findings indicate that the growth of Czech breastfed children differs from the current national references. These discrepancies were smaller compared to the WHO standards. The results of the study were used for new growth assessment guidelines to optimize feeding recommendations for Czech infants. The adoption of the WHO standards in the Czech Republic is not recommended.","","","FG","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","","wos:000353936800006","2-s2.0-84937203822","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0247175","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Autoři provedli retrospektivní epidemiologickou analýzu prevalencí vrozených vad u narozených dětí a prevalencí celkových (včetně prenatálně diagnostikovaných případů) z databáze Národního registru vrozených vad v České republice. Prevalence některých analyzovaných vrozených vad u narozených v průběhu sledovaného období 1994–2009 klesají (spina bifida, omfalokéla, kongenitální hydrocefalus) především díky úspěšné prenatální diagnostice. U jiných sledovaných diagnóz se prevalence u narozených nemění (anencefalie, encefalokéla). V případě anencefalie je tento stav dán tím, že hodnoty u narozených jsou minimální, prenatální diagnostika dosahuje téměř 100 %. V případě encefalokély je toto dáno velmi nízkou četností této diagnózy v populaci. Třetí skupinu tvoří vady, kdy se prevalence diagnózy u narozených zvyšují (gastroschíza, vrozené vady jícnu a anorektální malformace).

The authors performed a retrospective epidemiological analysis of the postnatal and overall (including prenatally diagnosed cases) prevalence of congenital anomalies from the database of the National Registry of Congenital Anomalies of the Czech Republic. The prevalence of some congenital anomalies (spina bifida, omphalocoele, and congenital hydrocephalus) showed a downward trend over the study period 1994–2009, mainly as a result of effective prenatal diagnosis. The prevalence of other congenital anomalies such as anencephaly or encephalocoele remained unchanged in live births. As for anencephaly, postnatally diagnosed cases were rare as the prenatal diagnosis was close to 100 %. The trend in encephalocoele is explained by the low incidence of this diagnosis in the population. The third group of postnatally diagnosed congenital anomalies such as gastroschisis or esophageal and anorectal anomalies were on the rise. As for gastroschisis, the reason was the changed approach to prenatal diagnosis due to good prognosis of this operable defect. The prevalence of congenital esophageal and anorectal anomalies varied between years, with a slowly increasing trend, similarly to diaphragmatic hernia.","","FK","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","","wos:000353309200009","2-s2.0-84928549913","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0247169","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The reason is that we have to process systems of uncertainties for which the classical conditions like sigma-additivity or linear ordering of values are too restrictive to define sufficiently closely the nature of uncertainty we would like to specify and process. In cases of non-numerical uncertainty degrees, at least the following two criteria may be considered. The first criterion should be systems with rather complicated, but sophisticated and nontrivially formally analyzable uncertainty degrees, e. g., uncertainties supported by some algebras or partially ordered structures. Contrarily, we may consider easier relations, which are non-numerical but interpretable on the intuitive level. Well-known examples of such structures are set-valued possibilistic measures. Some specific interesting results in this direction are introduced and analyzed in this contribution.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.14736/kyb-2015-3-0391","wos:000361266300002","2-s2.0-84940036692","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0246735","RVO:67985807","1","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that a stationary iteration scheme in the residual-updating form is significantly more accurate than in its direct-splitting form when employing inexact inner solves.

While the experimental setup and protocol are usually fixed, the method used for the model parameter estimation, i.e. the data processing step, is not well established. In order to enhance the quantitative analysis of experimental (noisy) FRAP data, we firstly formulate the inverse problem of model parameter estimation and then we focus on how the different methods of data pre- processing influence the confidence interval of the estimated parameters, namely the diffusion constant $p$. Finally, we present a preliminary study of two methods for the computation of a least-squares estimate $\\hat{p}$ and its confidence interval.","","","BA","","","Programs and Algorithms of Numerical Mathematics /17./.

With this tool, each graph can be decomposed into four parts: a set of vertices of huge degree, regular pairs (in the sense of the regularity lemma), and two other objects each exhibiting certain expansion properties.

The core idea, closely related to the sensitivity analysis, is based on discerning between relevant and irrelevant data. Presented mathematical model allows to visualize the mutual relation between the FRAP and FLIP methods. The whole concept resides in the processing of full spatio-temporal data instead of the space averaged  time series (FRAP recovery curves). The method theoretically confirms the empirical knowledge, that the mobility of fluorescent molecules can be determined with both FRAP and FLIP methods (using the full data  approach). Our analysis, based on the idealized theoretical case study, supports the conclusions of our recent experiments and thus it validates  the reliability of our new approach. The presented finding are expected to be reflected into experimental protocol setup as well as we will continue working on the further enhancing the method of parameter identification.","","","BA","","Acknowledgement.

The approach is based on the technique of a Taylor model integration, however, a novel method is introduced to suppress the wrapping effect over several integration steps. This method is simpler and more robust compared to the known methods. It allows more general inputs, while it does not require rigorous matrix inversion. Moreover, our integration algorithm allows the use of various types of underlying function enclosures. We present rigorous arithmetic operations with function enclosures based on the truncated Chebyshev series. Computational experiments are used to show the wrapping effect suppression of our method and to compare integration algorithm that uses Chebyshev function enclosures with the existing algorithms that use function enclosures based on the truncated Taylor series (Taylor models).","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.1007/s11075-014-9889-x","wos:000353508200011","2-s2.0-84940235016","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0245684","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little attention has been given to the choice of the fuzzy measure in the literature; usually, the Sugeno lambda-measure is used. A weakness of the Sugeno lambda-measure is that it cannot model the interactions between individual classifiers. That motivated us to develop two novel fuzzy measures and a modification of an existing fuzzy measure which are interaction-sensitive, i.e., they model not only the confidences of classifiers, but also their mutual similarities. The properties of the measures are first studied theoretically, and in the experimental section, the performance of the proposed measures is compared to the traditionally used additive measure and Sugeno lambda-measure. Experiments on 23 benchmark datasets and 3 different classifier systems show that the interaction-sensitive fuzzy measures clearly outperform their non-interaction sensitive counterparts.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.1016/j.fss.2014.09.005","wos:000352208900002","2-s2.0-84926246510","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0245683","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Copulas are widely used for studying dependence among continuously distributed random variables, with applications in finance and quantitative risk management; see, e.g., the pricing of collateralized debt obligations (Hofert and Scherer, Quantitative Finance, 11(5), 775–787, 2011). The ability to model complex dependence structures among variables has recently become increasingly popular in the realm of statistics, one example being data mining (e.g., cluster analysis, evolutionary algorithms or classification). The present work considers an estimator for both the structure and the parameters of hierarchical Archimedean copulas. Such copulas have recently become popular alternatives to the widely used Gaussian copulas. The proposed estimator is based on a pairwise inversion of Kendall’s tau estimator recently considered in the literature but can be based on other estimators as well, such as likelihood-based. A simple algorithm implementing the proposed estimator is provided. Its performance is investigated in several experiments including a comparison to other available estimators. The results show that the proposed estimator can be a suitable alternative in the terms of goodness-of-fit and computational efficiency. Additionally, an application of the estimator to copula-based Bayesian classification is presented. A set of new Archimedean and hierarchical Archimedean copula-based Bayesian classifiers is compared with other commonly known classifiers in terms of accuracy on several well-known datasets. The results show that the hierarchical Archimedean copula-based Bayesian classifiers are, despite their limited applicability for high-dimensional data due to expensive time consumption, similar to highly-accurate classifiers like support vector machines or ensemble methods on low-dimensional data in terms of accuracy while keeping the produced models rather comprehensible.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2016","","10.1007/s10844-014-0350-3","wos:000372261600002","2-s2.0-84954362268","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0245680","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

This complexity measure has recently been introduced for feedforward architectures (i.e., threshold circuits). We shortly survey the tradeoff results which relate the energy to other complexity measures such as the size and depth of threshold circuits. We generalize the energy complexity for recurrent architectures which counts the number of simultaneously active neurons at any time instant of a computation. We present our energy-time tradeoff result for the recurrent neural nets which are known to be computationally as powerful as the finite automata. In particular, we show the main ideas of simulating any deterministic finite automaton by a low-energy optimal-size neural network. In addition, we present a lower bound on the energy of such a simulation (within a certain range of time overhead) which implies that the energy demands in a fixedsize network increase exponentially with the frequency of presenting the input bits.","","","IN","","invited paper *** POZOR mozna je to KONFERENCE *** hodui2015  *** autor trvá na tom, že se jedná o kapitolu v knize, je to přepracovaný příspěvek z konference *** ano je to podle wos i scopus konference, nahrazeno záznamem C 0472477","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.1007/978-3-319-09903-3_3","wos:000380528700003","2-s2.0-85008397780","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0245620","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We will describe structure of the system developed during the TACR TA02031411 project and mention some of its specific functionalities. Further, we will explain in detail statistical modeling methodology which underlies the forecasting model in the core of the prediction procedure. Whole system relies on the use of indirect but very precise and relatively cheap to obtain toll transaction data (accessible through a cooperation with Kapsch Telematic Services, Inc.). Our statistical modeling starts with a recognition of the fact that the number of trucks parking at a given lot and given time is a latent variable to be estimated from the observable toll transaction data (which are available in the form of times when individual truck pass toll gates). After constructing appropriate proxy variable, we formulate a flexible class of statistical semi-parametric models constructed in a Markovian fashion. In fact, our model can be viewed as a non-homogeneous Markov chain, whose Poissonian transition probabilities change with several external covariates (describing e.g. weekly and daily periodicity of parking intensities) as well as spatially. Once the model is estimated (its parametric and nonparametric parts are estimated simultaneously), it is used for real time prediction for several short to medium horizons, using Monte Carlo simulations to obtain efficient and robust software implementation. We will demonstrate practical performance of the prediction system under routine conditions, based on evaluation against manual parking lot counting.","","","BB","","","ICTTE 2014.

The purpose of this comparative study was to analyze fat- and fiber-related behavior (FFB) in patients with T2DM from distinct cultural areas.    Patients and methods: Observational study was carried out in the Czech Republic (CR) (n=200), the US (n=207), and Yemen (n=200). Patients completed the Fat- and Fiber-related Diet Behavior Questionnaire (FFBQ).    Results: Differences in all aspects of FFB among countries were found (P<0.05). The best fat-related behavior reported was from patients from the CR. Patients from the US showed the worst fat-related behavior in total. On the other hand, patients from the US reported the best fiber-related behavior. Patients from Yemen reached the worst scores in all fat-related domains. Patients from all studied countries reported the best results in the “modify meat” and “avoid fat as flavoring” and the worst in the “substitute high fiber” subscales.    Conclusion: Professionals involved in the diet education of T2DM patients should be aware of the specificity of diet in their country when advising patients keeping general recommendations. We suggest them to be as specific as possible and concentrate on fiber-related behavior.","","","FR","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2015","","10.2147/PPA.S71373","wos:000349661700002","2-s2.0-84923226901","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0244965","RVO:67985807","0;1","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most of the data available has been gathered from chronic patients, and was therefore possibly confounded by factors such as duration of the disease, and treatment received. The extent and localization of these changes is also not clear. Methods: We examined a population of early stage SZ patients using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). 77 SZ patients and 60 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the analysis using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). We have also analyzed 250 randomly created subsets of the original cohort, to investigate the relation between the result of TBSS analysis, and the size of the sample studied. Results: We have found a significant decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the patient group. This change is present in most major white matter (WM) tracts including the corpus callosum, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and posterior thalamic radiation. Furthermore, we identified a clear trend towards an increase in the number and spatial extent of significant voxels reported, with an increasing number of subjects included in the analysis. Conclusion: Our study shows that FA is significantly decreased in patients at an early stage of schizophrenia, and that the extent of this finding is dependent on the size of studied sample; therefore underpowered studies might produce results with false spatial localization.","","","FH","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2015","","10.1016/j.schres.2015.01.029","wos:000349966400004","2-s2.0-84923229487","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0244811","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

It is devoted to the techniques for the models developing suitable for processes forecasting in complex systems. Because of the high sensitivity of the processes to the initial conditions and, consequently, due to our limited possibilities to forecast the processes for the long-term horizon, the attention is focused on the techniques leading to practical applications of the short term prediction models. The aim of this tutorial paper is to bring attention to possible difficulties which designers of the predicting models and their users meet and which have to be solved during the prediction model developing, validation, testing, and applications. The presented overview is not complete, it only reflects the author's experience with developing of the prediction models for practical tasks solving in banking, meteorology, air pollution and energy sector. The paper is completed by an example of the global solar radiation prediction which forms an important input for the electrical energy production forecast from renewable sources. The global solar radiation forecasting is based on numerical weather prediction models. The time-lagged ensemble technique for uncertainty quantification is demonstrated on a simple example.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","","10.14311/NNW.2014.24.032","wos:000348408100001","2-s2.0-84920727160","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0243100","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Unbiased square root ensemble filters use deterministic algorithms to produce an analysis (posterior) ensemble with a prescribed mean and covariance, consistent with the Kalman update. This includes several filters used in practice, such as the ensemble transform Kalman filter, the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter, and a filter by Whitaker and Hamill. We show that at every time index, as the number of ensemble members increases to infinity, the mean and covariance of an unbiased ensemble square root filter converge to those of the Kalman filter, in the case of a linear model and an initial distribution of which all moments exist.

For each FLew-algebra, the sets of its satisfiable and positively satisfiable terms can be viewed as fragments of its existential theory; we identify and investigate the complements as fragments of its universal theory. We offer characterizations of those algebras that (positively) satisfy just those terms that are satisfiable in the two-element Boolean algebra providing its semantics to classical propositional logic. In case of positive satisfiability, these algebras are just the nontrivial weakly contractive algebras. In case of satisfiability, we give a characterization by means of another property of the algebra, the existence of a two-element congruence. Further, we argue that (positive) satisfiability problems in FLew-algebras are computationally hard. Some previous results in the area of term satisfiabilty in MV-algebras or BL-algebras, are thus brought to a common footing with, e.g., known facts on satisfiability in Heyting algebras.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","10.1016/j.tcs.2016.03.009","wos:000377839900001","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0242470","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Our method, based on residuated frames, offers a uniform proof for many of the known densification and standard completeness results in the literature. We propose a syntactic criterion for densification, called semi-anchoredness. We then prove that the semilinear varieties of integral FL algebras defined by semi-anchored equations admit densification, so that the corresponding fuzzy logics are standard complete. Our method also applies to (possibly non-integral) commutative FL chains. We prove that the semilinear varieties of commutative FL algebras defined by knotted axioms x^m<=x^n (with m, n > 1) admit densification. It provides a purely algebraic proof to the standard completeness of uninorm logic as well as its extensions by knotted axioms.","","","BA","","není ústav, pouze ústavní grant tedy bez RVO","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2017","","10.1007/s00012-016-0372-5","wos:000375423100003","2-s2.0-84957958237","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0242323","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

This is true not only for the dropping based on magnitude of entries but it also applies to algorithms that use a prescribed sparsity pattern. This paper deals with dropping strategies for a class of AINV-type incomplete decompositions (Benzi et al., 1996) that are based on the generalized Gram–Schmidt process. Its behavior in finite precision arithmetic has been discussed in Rozložník et al. (2012). This analysis enables better understanding of the incomplete process, and the main goal of the paper is to propose a new adaptive dropping strategy and to illustrate its efficiency for problems in structural mechanics. In addition, we add a brief comparison with another approximate inverse preconditioning strategy that is based on different principles and used in engineering applications.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2015","","10.1016/j.advengsoft.2015.01.006","wos:000353008100003","2-s2.0-84925428056","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0242122","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We point out that standard image analysis procedures, which are implemented in the beadarray package of BioConductor software, are highly sensitive to contamination by severe noise and outliers. Therefore, the habitually used methodology does not discover many of the outliers. We illustrate this on real data and show that the standard background correction method may actually amplify the noise in the image. A robust image analysis tailor-made for this type of microarray images is highly desirable. We explain principles and show preliminary results of our robust alternative to the standard approach, which aims to be robust to noise and outliers in each its step.","","","IN","","též poster *** CD ROM","BIOIMAGING 2015.

The authors analyzed ranges of joint angles and simple rhythmical movement: swinging segments of walking subjects´ arms moving in-phase (synchronously) or antiphase (reciprocally), and designed fuzzy expert system which has never been described before. The set of data to create and study fuzzy logic for identifying upper extremity angles was measured in ten volunteers. An Xbus Kit system was used to measure upper limb movements. The joint angles in the sagittal plane and angle in the frontal plane were determined and relation maps of the in-phase and antiphase movements in the contralateral and ipsilateral joints were designed. The if-then rules were derived from experimental findings and knowledge about ranges of angles and relations between angles of upper limbs during walking. The estimated values of joint angles were compared with the observed values of joint angles. Spearman’s correlation coefficients were calculated for this purpose, and strong correlations for the walking speed of 3 km/h and 5 km/h were observed. The FS based on relation maps of the inphase and anti-phase movements in the contralateral and ipsilateral joints have shown to be suitable for the estimation of joint angles of upper limb during walking. The concept of the FS offers a wide range of application in rehabilitation and prostheses design.","","","FI","","FLASH disk *** prověřit vydavatele a místo vydání ***  možná ISBN 978-1-4799-8221-9 *** This work was done in the Joint Department of the FBE CTU and CU in Prague in the framework of research program No.VG20102015002 (2010–2015, MV0/VG), SGS 14/094/OHK4/1T/17 and 14/170/OHK4/2T/17.","SAMI 2015.

This paper presents new developments, which were introduced as a response to the needs of the community interested in operational testing of WR-SFIRE. These developments include a fuel-moisture model and a fuel-moisture-data-assimilation system based on the Remote Automated Weather Stations (RAWS) observations, allowing for fire simulations across landscapes and time scales of varying fuel-moisture conditions. The paper also describes the implementation of a coupling with the atmospheric chemistry and aerosol schemes in WRF-Chem, which allows for a simulation of smoke dispersion and effects of fires on air quality. There is also a data-assimilation method, which provides the capability of starting the fire simulations from an observed fire perimeter, instead of an ignition point. Finally, an example of operational deployment in Israel, utilizing some of the new visualization and datamanagement tools, is presented.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","","10.5194/nhess-14-2829-2014","wos:000344729800016","2-s2.0-84910086382","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0240606","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, systematic design of complex ensemble-based systems is still a pressing issue. This stems from the fact that contemporary design methods do not scale in terms of the number and complexity of ensembles and components, and do not efficiently cope with the dynamism involved. To address this issue, we present a novel method - Invariant Refinement Method (IRM) - for designing ensemble-based component systems by building on goal-based requirements elaboration, while integrating component architecture design and software control system design.","","","JC","","na žádost TB vyřazeno ze sběru RIV v 2015","CBSE 2013.

Being distributed and typically based on periodic activities, CPS have to cope with the problem that data capturing a distributed state of the system and its environment are inherently inaccurate (they represent belief on the state). In particular, this poses a problem when dependability is being pursued. In this paper we address this issue by modeling belief at the architecture level. In particular, we enhance the architecture by models describing belief inaccuracy over time. We exploit these models to quantify at runtime the impact of belief staleness on its inaccuracy. We then use this quantification to drive architectural adaptation with the aim to increase dependability of the running CPS system.","","","JC","UT WOS nezjištěno","na žádost TB vyřazeno ze sběru 2015","WICSA 2014.

The management of application deployment needs to ensure that the offloading provides users with the expected benefits, but it suddenly needs to cope with a highly dynamic environment which lacks a central authority and in which computational nodes appear and disappear. We propose an approach to the management of ad-hoc systems in such dynamic environment using component ensembles that connect mobile devices with more powerful computation nodes. Our approach aims to address the challenges of scalability and robustness of such systems without the need for central authority, relying instead on simple patterns that lead to reasonable adaptation decisions based on limited and imprecise information.","","","JC","UT WOS nezjištěno","","ICPE 2013.

Recent research centered around the concept of ensemble-based systems resulted in design and development models that aim to systematize and simplify the engineering process of autonomic components and their ensembles. These methods highlight the importance of covering both the functional concepts and the non-functional properties, specifically performance-related aspects of the future systems. In this paper we propose an integration of the emerging techniques for performance assessment and awareness into different stages of the development process. Our goal is to aid both designers and developers of autonomic component ensembles with methods providing performance awareness throughout the entire development life cycle (including runtime).","","","JC","","","ISoLA 2014.

Although Component-Based Development (CBD) might seem as a viable solution to target the complexity of smart CPS, existing component models scarcely cope with the open-ended and very dynamic nature of smart CPS. This is especially true for design-time modeling using hierarchical explicit architectures, which traditionally provide an excellent means of coping with complexity by providing multiple levels of abstractions and explicitly specifying communication links between component instances. In this paper we propose a modeling method (materialized in the SOFA NG component model) which conveys the benefits of explicit architectures of hierarchical components to the design of smart CPS. Specifically, we base our method on modeling systems as reference architectures of Software Product Lines (SPL). Contrary to traditional SPL, which is a fully design-time approach, we create SPL configurations at runtime. We do so in a decentralized way by translating the configuration process to the process of establishing component ensembles (i.e. dynamic cooperation groups of components) of our DEECo component model.","","","JC","UT WOS nezjištěno","na žádost TB vyřazeno ze sběru do RIV 2015","CBSE 2014.

Over short horizons, forecasting solar irradiance is often performed by extrapolation of field measurements. Four tailored statistical models for forecasting hourly average solar irradiance are proposed and assessed in this paper. These follow from the well-known regression and ARIMA class of models, but bring into the model formulation various physically motivated additional features. These capture the distribution of solar radiation more effectively. Their performance is compared with the performance of a standard model used in the strictly black-box style often encountered in practice. Overall results demonstrate that the proposed models are significantly more accurate than the standard model, under conditions of mostly cloudy skies.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2015","","10.1016/j.solener.2014.11.003","wos:000348259200028","2-s2.0-84911420678","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0240249","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The processors are ""embodied"" meaning that each of them has its own source of energy, has a ""body"" equipped with various sensors and communication means and has a computational control part. Initially, the processors have no identifiers and from the technological reasons, in the interest of their maximal simplicity, their computational, communication, sensory and locomotion (if any) parts are reduced to an absolute minimum. The processors communicate wirelessly, e.g., in an airborne medium they communicate via a short-range radio, acoustically or optically and in a waterborne medium via molecular communication. In the extreme cases the computational part of the processors can be simplified down to probabilistic finite state automata or even combinatorial circuits and the system as a whole can still be made universally programmable. From the theoretical point of view the structure and the properties of the amorphous systems qualify them among the simplest (non-uniform) universal computational devices. From the practical viewpoint, once technology will enable a mass production of the required processors a host of new applications so far inaccessible to classical approaches to computing will follow.","","","IN","","","CMC15.

The relational semantics of this logic is similar to the relational semantics of intuitionistic modal logic and positive modal logic, but it generalizes both of these by placing no restrictions on the accessibility relation. We introduce a corresponding quasivariety of distributive lattices with modal operators and prove a completeness theorem which embeds each such algebra in the complex algebra of its canonical modal frame. We then extend this embedding to a duality theorem which unies and generalizes the duality theorems for intuitionistic modal logic obtained by A. Palmigiano and for positive modal logic obtained by S. Celani and A. Jansana. As a corollary to this duality theorem, we obtain a Hennessy-Milner theorem for bi- intuitionistic unimodal logic, which is the expansion of distributive unimodal logic by bi-intuitionistic connectives.","","","BA","","","Advances in Modal Logic.

This study aimed to evaluate the extent of delay in diagnosis and treatment of TB in Uzbekistan and identify associated risk factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on hospital patients with newly diagnosed TB. The time between the onset of respiratory symptoms and initiation of anti-TB treatment was assessed and delays were divided into patient, health system and total delays. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate determinants of diagnostic and treatment delay. Results: Among 538 patients enrolled, the median delay from onset of symptoms until treatment with anti-TB drugs was 50 days. Analysis of the factors affecting health-seeking behaviour and timely treatment showed the presence of the patient factor. Self-medication was the first health-seeking action for 231 (43%) patients and proved to be a significant predictor of delay (p = 0.005), as well as coughing (p = 0.009), loss of weight (p = 0.001), and visiting private and primary healthcare facilities (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively). Conclusion: TB diagnostic and treatment delay was mainly contributed to by patient delay and should be reduced through increasing public awareness of TB symptoms and improving public healthseeking behaviour for timely initiation of anti-TB treatment. Efforts should be made to minimise irrational use of antibiotics and support interventions to restrict over-the-counter availability of antibiotics.","","","FR","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","","10.1186/s12879-014-0624-y","wos:000346606200002","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0239819","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we present population initialization methods within a framework of GP over simply typed lambda calculus that can be also used in the standard GP approach. Initializations can be parameterized by different search strategies, leading to wide spectrum of methods corresponding to standard ramped halfand- half initialization on one hand, or exhaustive systematic search on the other. A novel geometric strategy is proposed that balances those two approaches. Experiments on well known benchmark problems show that the geometric strategy outperforms the standard generating method in success rate, best fitness value, time consumption and average individual size.","","","IN","","ISBN podle SCOPUS ISBN: 978-147991488-3 - to je možná cd ROM a je to i ve wosu, takze se to lisi od RIVu","CEC 2014.

The wireless communication ability and the memory capacity of the computational units is severely restricted due to their minimal size. Moreover, the units originally have no identifiers and can only use simple asynchronous communication protocols that cannot guarantee a reliable message delivery. In this work we concentrate on a so-called robust flying amorphous computer whose units are in a constant motion. The units are modelled by miniature RAMs communicating via radio. For this model we design a distributed probabilistic communication protocol and an algorithm enabling a simulation of a RAM in finite time. Our model is robust in the sense that if one or several computational units fail the computer will autonomously restart and reconfigure itself in order to initiate the computation anew. The underlying algorithms make use of a number of original ideas having no counterpart in the classical theory of distributed computing.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","","10.1007/978-3-319-13350-8_31","wos:000355015600032","2-s2.0-84916891551","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0239715","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

They contain a unique combination of light-harvesting systems represented by a membrane-bound antenna and by phycobilisomes situated on thylakoid membrane surfaces. So far, very little has been revealed about the mobility of their phycobilisomes and the regulation of their light-harvesting system in general. Therefore, we carried out a detailed analysis of phycobilisome dynamics in several red alga strains and compared these results with the presence (or absence) of photoprotective mechanisms. Our data conclusively prove phycobilisome mobility in two model mesophilic red alga strains, Porphyridium cruentum and Rhodella violacea. In contrast, there was almost no phycobilisome mobility in the thermophilic red alga Cyanidium caldarium that was not caused by a decrease in lipid desaturation in this extremophile. Experimental data attributed this immobility to the strong phycobilisome-photosystem interaction that highly restricted phycobilisome movement. Variations in phycobilisome mobility reflect the different ways in which light-harvesting antennae can be regulated in mesophilic and thermophilic red algae. Fluorescence changes attributed in cyanobacteria to state transitions were observed only in mesophilic P. cruentum with mobile phycobilisomes, and they were absent in the extremophilic C. caldarium with immobile phycobilisomes. We suggest that state transitions have an important regulatory function in mesophilic red algae; however, in thermophilic red algae, this process is replaced by nonphotochemical quenching","","","EE","LO1205,ED2.1.00/01.0024","","","MBU-M","Mikrobiologický ústav AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Microbiology of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","","10.1104/pp.114.236075","wos:000341648600019","2-s2.0-84905266284","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0239776","RVO:61388971","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The approach is demonstrated in the detection of an information transfer from larger to smaller time scales in a model multifractal process and applied in a study of cross-scale interactions in atmospheric dynamics. Applying a form of the conditional mutual information and a statistical test based on the Fourier transform and multifractal surrogate data to about a century long records of daily mean surface air temperature from various European locations, an information transfer from larger to smaller time scales has been observed as the influence of the phase of slow oscillatory phenomena with the periods around 6–11 years on the amplitudes of the variability characterized by the smaller temporal scales from a few months to 4–5 years. These directed cross-scale interactions have a non-negligible effect on interannual air temperature variability in a large area of Europe.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","1","10.3390/e16105263","wos:000344459500008","2-s2.0-84907233984","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0239435","RVO:67985807","1","","","","","","","","","",""

So called Stein's paradox arises in estimating the mean of a multivariate standard normal random variable. Stein showed that both natural and intuitive estimate of a multivariate mean given by the observed vector itself is not even admissible and may be improved upon under the squared-error loss when the dimension is greater or equal to three. Later Stein and his student James developed so called ‘James–Stein estimator’, a shrunken estimate of the mean, which had uniformly smaller risk for all values in the parameter space. The paradox first appeared both unintuitive and even unacceptable, but later it was recognised as one of the most influential discoveries of all times in statistical science. Today the ‘shrinkage principle’ literally permeates the statistical technology for analysing multivariate data, and in its application is not exclusively confined to estimating the mean, but also the covariance structure of multivariate data. We develop shrinkage versions of both the linear and quadratic discriminant analysis and apply them to sparse multivariate gene expression data obtained at the Centre for Biomedical Informatics (CBI) in Prague.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2015","","10.1016/j.bbe.2014.10.004","wos:000351328300007","2-s2.0-84922934166","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0239322","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Material/Methods: The study included 215 women who underwent a TVT, TVT O or BCS procedure. We monitored QoL after each procedure and the effect of complications on the QoL as assessed by the IQOL questionnaire over a 3-year period. Results: The study was completed by 74.5% of women after TVT, 74.5% after TVT O, and 65.2% after BCS procedure. In the long-term, the QoL improved from 46.9 to 88.7 and remained stable after BCS; after TVT and TVT O, it declined, but only after TVT O was the decline statistically significant compared to BCS. The IQOL for women with post-operative complications has a clear descending tendency. The effect of the complications is highly significant (p < 0.001). Only the OAB complication had a statistically significant effect on QoL p < 0.001. Preexistent OAB does not negatively affect postoperative results of anti-incontinence surgery. Conclusions: There was a statistically significant decline with the longitudinal values of IQOL with TVT O, but not with TVT or BCS. Anti-incontinence operations significantly improve quality of life for women with MI, but compared to the SI group, the quality of life is worse when measured at a longer time interval after the operation. Anti-incontinence operations significantly improve quality of life, and the difference in preoperative status in the long-term follow-up is demonstrable.","","","FK","","dodatečně evidované před hodnocením","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","","2011","2015","","","wos:000287599700008","2-s2.0-79551708976","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0239192","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

This single-center randomized three-arm trial compared the objective and subjective efficacy and early failure rate of the TVT-O and TVT-S H and U approach by objective criteria (cough test) and subjective criteria using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF). The objective efficacy rate was defined as the number of patients with a negative cough stress test. Subjective cure was defined by no stress leakage of urine after surgery based on the evaluation of ICIQ-UI SH (when patients ticked ""Never""/""Urine does not leak"" in answer to question 6: When does urine leak?). Objective and subjective efficacy were evaluated using Last Failure Carried Forward analysis, i.e., final analysis also included patients with early failure. To describe outcome at different time points, the Last Observation Carried Forward method was also implemented. One hundred ninety-seven women with proven SUI were randomized into three groups-TVT-O (n = 68), TVT-S H (n = 64), and TVT-S U (n = 65). Each patient allocated to a treatment group received the planned surgery. There were no differences in each group in preoperative characteristics. Median follow-up after surgery was 2 years (SD, 0.8; range, 0.1 to 3.8 years). Of the subjects, 92.6% in the TVT-O group, 68.8% in the TVT-S H group, and 69.2% in the TVT-S U group had negative stress test (p < 0.001). Of the subjects, 85.3 % in the TVT-O group, 68.8% in the TVT-S H group, and 61.5% in the TVT-S U group were subjectively continent (p = 0.02).","","","FK","","dodatečně evidované před hodnocením","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","","2012","2015","","10.1007/s00192-012-1662-x","wos:000309079600014","2-s2.0-84868341904","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0239191","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditionally, transmission lines have been operated based on fixed deterministic thermal ratings, causing underutilization of their potential capacity. Efforts to overcome this limitation led to the development of alternative rating strategies based on probabilistic and dynamic methods. In this paper, a probabilistic static thermal rating method based on typical weather conditions along a transmission line is described and analyzed. The results of load and energy throughput analyses show that the use of this rating approach can significantly increase line throughput compared to traditional deterministic rating methods. However, this approach can also substantially increase the risk of thermal overload. To identify the problems associated with the use of a probabilistic static thermal rating method, we performed a sensitivity study. Statistical analysis of weather parameters shows that line ratings calculated from typical weather data are inflated. Additional results confirm that values of risk tolerance and wind direction incorporated into the rating method significantly affect the resulting rating values. We suggest values for these parameters that minimize the risk of line overloading.","","","JE","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2015","","10.1016/j.ijepes.2012.07.005","wos:000311864800025","2-s2.0-84866525048","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0239189","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

EGSYS-U, EGSYS-M, and OESIL risk scores for syncope evaluation are introduced, evaluated retrospectively, and their ability to classify cardiac syncopes is compared. The specificity and sensitivity of the scores were analyzed. Guidelines for the practical application of the scoring systems are provided to reduce unnecessary hospital admissions. Methods. Retrospectively, 153 patients with syncope admitted to the Faculty Hospital in Ostrava in the year 2008 were enrolled for scoring with the EGSYS and OESIL risk scores. The computed scores were assessed with respect to the diagnosed etiology of the syncope. Results. For each score system, the hypothesis that there is no difference in the score between the cardiac and the non-cardiac group was rejected (all p-values below 0.0001). Strong correlation between the three score systems  was shown (Spearman correlation coefficient: r = 0.71 p < 0.0001 for EGSYS-U and OESIL, r = 0.88 p < 0.0001 for EGSYS-U and EGSYS-M, r = 0.60 p < 0.0001 for EGSYS-M and OESIL). Sensitivity and specificity of the scores were computed and compared. Conclusions. All three score systems were found capable of classifying cardiac syncopes, reducing unnecessary hospital admissions and improving syncope risk evaluation. EGSYS-U was recommended for emergency syncope management because it was found to have both high sensitivity and high specificity.","","","IN","","dodatečně evidované před hodnocením","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","","2010","2015","","","wos:000279802800010","2-s2.0-77955535604","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0239188","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The identification, at some level, of these subsystems is an important step towards understanding climate dynamics. We present a method to determine the number of principal components representing non-random correlation structures in climate data, or components that cannot be generated by a surrogate model of independent stochastic processes replicating the auto-correlation structure of each time series. The purpose of the method is to automatically reduce the dimensionality of large climate datasets into spatially localised components suitable for further interpretation or, for example, for use as nodes in a complex network analysis of large-scale climate dynamics. We apply the method to two 2.5° resolution NCEP/NCAR reanalysis global datasets of monthly means: the sea level pressure (SLP) and the surface air temperature (SAT), and extract 60 components explaining 87 % variance and 68 components explaining 72 % variance, respectively. The obtained components are in agreement with previous results in that they recover many well-known climate modes previously identified using other approaches including regionally constrained principal component analysis. Selected SLP components are discussed in more detail with respect to their correlation with important climate indices and their relationship to other SLP and SAT components. Finally, we consider a subset of the obtained components that have not yet been explicitly identified by other authors but seem plausible in the context of regional climate observations discussed in literature.","","","BB","","hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2015","","10.1007/s00382-014-2244-z","wos:000351459800019","2-s2.0-84939888879","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0239434","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

It is  currently being tested for operational usage at the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (CHMI). The air quality forecast  (AQF) is designed to provide air quality predictions for the Czech Republic, and thereby compliment forecasts from  MEDARD which also focuses on a similar domain. The forecast will principally be operated to supplement existing air  quality information that is provided by the CHMI to the public.  This CHMI AQF is based on the chemical transport model CAMx. Meteorological inputs are obtained from the ALADIN  NWP model, run operationally at the CHMI. Anthropogenic emissions are prepared from a number of sources including the  Czech Republic's national emission inventory. This, in particular, allows detailed emission information to be processed for  the Czech Republic. A modified version of SMOKE is used to process emissions. The emission processing work has allowed  some emission sources to be released into above-ground layers with the aim of reflecting the real situation as best as  practicable. Biogenic emissions are prepared using BEIS. Boundary conditions for the model are extracted from MACC  products.  Performance evaluation of the forecast has not been completed and therefore results are not yet available. Nonetheless, the  chosen configurations are documented.","","","DG","","hodui2015","HARMO 15.

This theoretical contribution introduces a new definition of conflict between two belief functions on a general finite frame of discernment. Its idea is based on H´ajek-Vald´es algebraic analysis of belief functions, on our previous study of conflicts of belief functions, where internal conflicts of belief functions are distinguished from a conflict between belief functions, and on the decomposition of a belief function into its conflicting and non-conflicting parts. Basic properties of this newly defined conflict are presented, analyzed and briefly compared with our previous approaches to conflict as well as with Liu’s degree of conflict.","","","BA","UT WOS nezjištěno","hodui2015","BELIEF 2014.

However, in spite of a recent effort to improve irradiance prediction within current NWP models, its quality is still not satisfactory and it is responsible for a majority of uncertainty in photovoltaic power forecasting.

Preconditioning based on the incomplete LU factors of an n × n submatrix of the system matrix is our second approach. A new way to find this submatrix based on a specific weighted transversal problem is proposed. Numerical experiments demonstrate different algebraic and implementational features of the new approaches and put them into the context of current progress in preconditioning of CGLS.

In this paper, the focus is on extending the approach to sparse symmetric indefinite systems in saddle-point form. A limited-memory signed incomplete Cholesky factorization of the form $LDL^T$ is proposed, where the diagonal matrix $D$ has entries $\\pm 1$. The main advantage of this approach is its simplicity as it avoids the use of numerical pivoting. Instead, a global shift strategy involving two shifts (one for the $(1,1)$ block and one for the (2,2) block of the saddle-point matrix) is used to prevent breakdown and to improve performance. The matrix is optionally prescaled and preordered using a standard sparse matrix ordering scheme that is then postprocessed to give a constrained ordering that reduces the likelihood of breakdown and need for shifts. The use of intermediate memory (memory used in the construction of the incomplete factorization but subsequently discarded) is shown to significantly improve the performance of the resulting preconditioner. Some new theoretical results are presented, and for problems arising from a range of practical applications, numerical results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the signed incomplete Cholesky factorization as a preconditioner. Comparisons are made with a recent incomplete $LDL^T$ code that employs pivoting.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","","10.1137/140956671","wos:000346838800021","2-s2.0-84919623202","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0237112","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Such outliers, often referred to as anomalies, are nowadays more and more important, because they help to uncover interesting events within data. Consequently, a considerable amount of statistical and data mining techniques to identify anomalies was proposed in the last few years, but only a few works at least mentioned why some sample was labelled as an anomaly. Therefore, we propose a method based on specifically trained decision trees, called sapling random forest. Our method is able to interpret the output of arbitrary anomaly detector. The explanation is given as a subset of features, in which the sample is most deviating, or as conjunctions of atomic conditions, which can be viewed as antecedents of logical rules easily understandable by humans. To simplify the investigation of suspicious samples even more, we propose two methods of clustering anomalies into groups. Such clusters can be investigated at once saving time and human efforts.

The method is suitable for data with the number of variables exceeding the number of observations. The method is based on implicit weights assigned to individual observations. Our approach is a unique attempt to combine regularization and high robustness, allowing to downweight outlying high-dimensional observations. Classification performance of new methods and some ideas concerning classification analysis of high-dimensional data are illustrated on real raw data as well as on data contaminated by severe outliers.","","","IN","","","ITAT 2014.

Robust estimators of the autocorrelation coefficient are proposed in a straightforward way based on robust regression. Further, we consider the task of robust estimation of the autocorrelation coefficient of residuals of linear regression. The task is connected to verifying the assumption of independence of residuals and robust estimators of the autocorrelation coefficient are defined based on the Durbin-Watson test statistic for robust regression. The main result is obtained for the implicitly weighted autocorrelation coefficient with small weights assigned to outlying measurements. This estimator is based on the least weighted squares regression and we exploit its asymptotic properties to derive an asymptotic test that the autocorrelation coefficient is equal to 0. Finally, we illustrate different estimators on real economic data, which reveal the advantage of the approach based on the least weighted squares regression. The estimator turns out to be resistant against the presence of outlying measurements.","","","BB","","","International Days of Statistics and Economics /8./.

Further, our aim is cluster analysis of continuous data with a large number of variables. Various regularization techniques tailor-made for high-dimensional data have been proposed, which have however turned out to suffer from a high sensitivity to the presence of outlying measurements in the data.

We investigated the regulation by temperature of the aphid populations composed of Metopolophium dirhodum, Sitobion avenae, and Rhopalosiphum padi on winter wheat using a 24 years long time series data. We computed the sum of daily temperatures above 5°C, the threshold temperature for aphid development, and the sum of daily temperatures within the [0(threshold for wheat development),5] °C interval. Applying Generalised Additive Model framework we tested influences of temperature history expressed via degree days before the start of the aphid immigration on the length of their occurrence. We aimed to estimate the magnitude and direction of this influence, and how far to the past before the start of the aphid season the temperature effect goes and then identify processes responsible for the effect. We fitted four models that differed in the way of correcting for abundance in the previous year and in specification of temperature effects. Abundance in the previous year did not affect the length of period of aphid population growth on wheat. The temperature effect on the period length increased up to 123 days before the start of the current season, i.e. when wheat completed vernalization. Increased sum of daily temperatures above 5°C and the sum of daily temperatures within the [0,5] °C interval both shortened the length of period of aphid population growth. Stronger effect of the latter suggests that wheat can escape from aphid attacks if during winter temperatures range from 0 to 5°C. The temperature influence was not homogeneous in time. The strongest effect of past temperature was about 50 to 80 and 90 to 110 days before the beginning of the current aphid season indicating important role of termination of aphid egg dormancy and egg hatching.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","","10.1371/journal.pone.0106228","wos:000341257700039","2-s2.0-84906979421","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0236046","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

An interesting departure from that (classical) paradigm has been introduced by Hajek with his fuzzy probability logic when, while still keeping classical logic as interpretation of the lower syntactical layer, he proposed to use Lukasiewicz logic in the upper one, so that the truth degree of P(A) could be directly identified with the probability of A. Later, other authors have used the same formalism with different kinds of uncertainty measures and other pairs of logics, allowing for a treatment of uncertainty of vague events (i.e. also changing the logic in the lower layer). The aim of this paper is to provide a general framework for two-layer modal logics that encompasses all the previously studied two-layer modal fuzzy logics, provides a general axiomatization and a semantics of measured Kripke frames, and prove a general completeness theorem.","","","BA","","","WoLLIC 2014.

One has to deal with the dynamicity and unreliability of the physical environment where the software resides in, while, at the same time, provide sufficient levels of dependability and scalability. Although emerging software engineering abstractions, such as dynamic ad-hoc component ensembles, provide a convenient way to structure software for dynamic CPS, they need to be mapped to robust decentralized execution schemes in real-life settings. A particular challenge in this context is the robust distributed data dissemination in dynamic networks. Gossip-based communication stands as a promising solution to this challenge. We argue, that exploitation of application-specific information, software architecture in particular, has a large potential for improving the robustness and performance of gossip-based communication. This paper proposes a synergy between high-level architectural models and low-level communication models to effectively enable application-specific gossiping in component-based systems. The synergy is exemplified on the DEECo component model which is tailored to the needs and specifics of CPS, and evaluated on an emergency coordination case study with realistic network configurations.","","","JC","","hodui2015","ECSA 2014.

The main result is a sufficient condition for a language accepted by this automaton to be regular which is based on the new concept of a quasi-periodic power series.

The algorithm cleanly separates numerical from combinatorial computation. Based on this, the numerical part provably computes only the information that is strictly necessary for the following combinatorial part, and the combinatorial part may optimize its computation based on the numerical information computed before. We also present computational experiments based on an implementation of the algorithm. Also, in contrast to previous work, the algorithm does not assume knowledge of a Lipschitz constant of the function f, and works for arbitrary continuous functions for which some notion of interval arithmetic can be defined.","","","BA","se sberem 2015 se do RIV se dostal i projekt GCP202/12/J060 za AV (v autorite byl poskytovatel AV)","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2015","","10.1090/S0025-5718-2014-02877-9","wos:000358439500011","2-s2.0-84925266853","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0235754","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The processors are “embodied” meaning that each of them has its own source of energy, has a “body” equipped with various sensors and communication means and has a computational control part. Initially, the processors have no identifiers and from the technological reasons, in the interest of their maximal simplicity, their computational, communication, sensory and locomotion (if any) parts are reduced to an absolute minimum. The processors communicate wirelessly, e.g., in an airborne medium they communicate via a short-range radio, acoustically or optically and in a waterborne medium via molecular communication. In the extreme cases the computational part of the processors can be simplified down to probabilistic finite state automata or even combinatorial circuits and the system as a whole can still be made universally programmable. From the theoretical point of view the structure and the properties of the amorphous systems qualify them among the simplest (non-uniform) universal computational devices. From the practical viewpoint, once technology will enable a mass production of the required processors a host of new applications so far inaccessible to classical approaches to computing will follow.","","","IN","","invited paper","CMC15.

Each distribution including the heavy-tailed ones and random samples from them are described by a typical value and variability. Further, we discuss the generalized (score) moment estimates and a distribution-dependent score correlation coefficient for continuous random variables, and present results of simulation experiments with data generated from heavy-tailed distributions. Since score functions of distribution of heavy-tailed distributions are bounded, the point estimates as well as the sample score correlation coefficients are insensitive to outliers.","","","BB","","","COMPSTAT 2014.

There have been a number of component frameworks developed for this purpose,  and some of them have already became well established in this area. Even though these  frameworks share the general idea of component-based development, they significantly differ  in the range of supported features and maturity. This makes it relatively difficult to select  the right component framework and thus poses a significant obstacle in adoption of the  component-based development approach for developing real-time embedded systems. To  provide guidance in choosing a component framework, or at least relevant concepts when  building a custom framework, we present a survey, which illustrates distinguishing features  and provides comparison of selected modern component-based frameworks for real-time  embedded systems. Compared to other existing surveys, this survey focuses specifically on  criteria connected with real-time and embedded systems. Further, to be practically relevant,  we restrict the survey only to the frameworks that support the full development life cycle (i.e. from design till execution support). In this context, the survey illustrates the complexity of  development in each framework by giving specification and code samples.","","","JC","","na žádost TB vyřazeno ze sběru do RIV 2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","","2014","2015","","10.1007/s10115-013-0627-9","wos:000337033900005","2-s2.0-84902157015","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0235456","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Design The purpose of this study was to determine what proportion of this CHD mortality decline could be associated with temporal trends in major CHD risk factors and what proportion with advances in medical and surgical treatments. Methods The validated IMPACT mortality model was used to combine and analyse data on uptake and effectiveness of CHD management and risk factor trends in the Czech Republic in adults aged 25–74 years between 1985 and 2007. The main sources were official statistics, national quality of care registries, published trials and meta-analyses, and the Czech MONICA and Czech post-MONICA studies. Results Between 1985 and 2007, age-adjusted CHD mortality rates in the Czech Republic decreased by 66.2% in men and 65.4% in women in the age group 25–74 years, representing 12,080 fewer CHD deaths in 2007. Changes in CHD risk factors explained approximately 52% of the total mortality decrease, and improvements in medical treatments approximately 43%. Increases in body mass index and in diabetes prevalence had a negative impact, increasing CHD mortality by approximately 1% and 5%, respectively. Conclusions More than half of the very substantial fall in CHD mortality in the Czech Republic between 1985 and 2007 was attributable to reduction in major cardiovascular risk factors. Improvement in treatments accounted for approximately 43% of the total mortality decrease. These findings emphasize the value of primary prevention and evidence-based medical treatment.","","","FA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","1","10.1177/2047487312469476","wos:000337571700005","2-s2.0-84902583434","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0235454","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

MA exposure is associated with changes in the function of neurotransmitter systems, namely the dopaminergic, serotonergic and glutamatergic systems. Since N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDA) are affected by MA-induced glutamate release, we assessed the expression of NMDAR subunits (NR1, NR2A, and NR2B) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), which is connected with NMDAR. We measured the expression of these proteins in adolescent (30 days old) and adult (60 days old) rat males exposed to MA during the entire prenatal period and compared them with the same parameters in age matched saline-exposed rats. There was a significant increase in the NR1 and NR2B subunits in the hippocampus of adult males, but not in adolescent males. We identified a significant change in adult MA-induced rats when compared to adult controls for NR2A and NR2B, while in adolescent MA rats this change was close to the boundary of significance. In summary, our study suggests that prenatal MA exposure is connected with changes in NMDAR subunit expression in adult rats but not in adolescent rats.","","","FH","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","","10.1007/s11064-014-1381-4","wos:000343293000003","2-s2.0-84910107229","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0235452","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

To design and analyze relevant energy management strategies, we have developed Simulink-based models of a recently constructed monitoring device to evaluate its potential performance. The model uses long-term solar energy data from two locations, Chamela, Mexico, and Fairview, Canada, to estimate the energy harvesting capabilities of the device. Using the simulator, we have developed and evaluated a fuzzy energy management strategy that determines how the device should operate to match the solar energy profile in each location. Solar energy in Chamela, Mexico is abundant and consistent so an energy harvesting remote monitoring device could have a high activity level without risking device failure. Fairview, Canada, has limited solar resources in the winter but plenty in the summer; a device dependent upon this energy source must adapt its activity level to match energy availability or risk running out of energy. While the simulated device in Mexico outperforms the one in Canada, both succeed in matching the available environmental resources and largely avoid energy related device failure. In the future, their performance can be improved by optimizing the designed strategies and further improving the details of the simulation.","","","IN","","eISBN je 978-1-4799-1484-5, tištěné je 978-1-4799-6627-1, volím podle Scopus elektronickou formu **** kanadani jsou i z Ostravy?","IJCNN 2014.

This contribution studies the conditions under which such a decomposition exists for belief functions defined on a three-element frame. A generalisation of important Hájek-Valdés homomorphism f of semigroup of belief functions onto its subsemigroup of indecisive belief functions is found and presented. A class of quasi-Bayesian belief functions, for which the decomposition into conflicting and non-conflicting parts exists is specified. A series of other steps towards a conflicting part of a belief function are presented. Several open problems from algebra of belief functions which are related to the investigated topic and are necessary for general solution of the issue of decomposition are formulated.","","","BA","","","IPMU 2014 /15./.

A generalized measure based on Kendall’s tau adapted for purposes of the estimation is introduced. A simple algorithm implementing the method is provided and its effectiveness is shown in several experiments including its comparison to other available methods.

With the growing amount of intermittent energy sources, the need for precise weather predictions increases. Production of energy from renewable power sources, such as wind and solar, can be predicted using numerical weather prediction models. These models can provide high-resolution, localized forecast of wind speed and solar irradiation. However, different instances of numerical weather prediction models may provide different forecasts, depending on their properties and parameterizations. To alleviate this problem, it is possible to employ multiple models and to combine their outputs to obtain more accurate localized forecasts. This work uses the machine-learning tool of Support Vector Regression to amalgamate downward short-wave radiation forecasts of several numerical weather prediction models. Results of SVR-based multi-model forecasts of irradiation at a large set of locations show a significant improvement of prediction accuracy.","","","IN","UT WOS nezjištěno","eISBN je 978-1-4799-1484-5, tištěné je 978-1-4799-6627-1, volím podle Scopus elektronickou formu *** hodui2015 pelikán","IJCNN 2014.

A used data set contains 7440 observations corresponding to distributions of electrical potential at the head surface obtained by Independent Component Analysis of 155 48-channel EEG recordings over 16 subjects. The distributions are interpreted as produced by the current dipolar sources inside the head. To reveal the sources of electrical brain activity the most typical for motor imagery, the corresponding ICA components were clustered by Attractor Neural Network with Increasing Activity (ANNIA). ANNIA was already successfully applied to clustering textual documents and genome data [8,11]. Among the expected clusters of components (blinks and mu-rhythm ERD) the ones reflecting the frontal and occipital cortex activity were also extracted. Although the cluster analysis can not substitute careful data examination and interpretation however it is a useful pre-processing step which can clearly aid in revealing data regularities which are impossible to tract by sequentially browsing through the data","","","IN","","isbnonline 978-3-319-08156-4","IBICA 2014.

An additional aim was to discuss differences reflecting the structural and functional changes of fat tissue. The study group included 130 adult Caucasian women stratified by body mass index (BMI): 18-24.99 (n=30), 25-29.99 (n=26), 30-34.99 (n=33), 35-39.99 (n=30), and BMI≥40 (n=11). Bioelectrical impedance was performed using Tanita TBF 410 GS, Bodystat 1500, and Omron BF 300. A caliper type Best was also applied. Correspondence of four methods with DEXA was assessed using the Bland-Altman and ANOVA analyses. Measurements by BIA were not significantly different from DEXA up to BMI of 30, but DEXA significantly overestimated in the higher BMI subgroup by all three methods. Caliper measurement significantly underestimated DEXA in all BMI subgroups. BIA methods overestimated DEXA for the obese subjects. Tanita did statistically the best. The Caliper test appeared less preferable than the BIA methods, especially in the higher BMI subgroup. DEXA and Caliper measurements seem to be the best estimate of structural (anatomical) fat quantity. We hypothesize that BIA methods could also measure some other physiopathological conditions like inflammation, hydration or cell infiltration of fat.","","","FB","DOI nezjištěno","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","","","wos:000345590400008","2-s2.0-84903757062","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0234479","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Given a propositional logic (for which we only need to assume that it has an algebraic semantics and a suitable disjunction) we axiomatize two natural first-order extensions and prove that one is complete with respect to all models over its algebras, while the other one is complete with respect to all models over relatively finitely subdirectly irreducible ones. While the first completeness result is relatively straightforward, the second requires non-trivial modifications of Henkin’s proof by making use of the disjunction connective. As a byproduct, we also obtain a form of Skolemization provided that the algebraic semantics admits regular completions. The relatively modest assumptions on the propositional side allow for a wide generalization of previous approaches by Rasiowa, Sikorski, Hájek, Horn, and others and help to illuminate the “essentially first-order” steps in the classical Henkin’s proof.","","","BA","","hodnoceniui2015 cintula *** soutez2016","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2015","","10.1017/jsl.2014.19","wos:000351311600018","2-s2.0-84937900561","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0234002","RVO:67985807","1;0","","","","","","","","","",""

It is proven that if two Gaussian RBF networks have the same input–output functions, then they must have the same numbers of units with the same centers and widths.

Based on this assumption, we examined the ability of AFS to indicate macrofungal diversity in six study areas covering a range of elevations and environments in the Czech Republic. In total, we used data from 106 sampling plots (2,500 m2 each) distributed over six types of forest stands reflecting different intensities and temporal stages of forest management. Species composition of vascular plants and macrofungi was recorded by a single inventory and regular 2-year monitoring, respectively. In total, we found 71 AFS and 1,413 macrofungal species, of which 150 were red-listed macrofungal species. We documented that AFS show potential for being used in the prediction of macrofungi species richness, including endangered species, at the local scale (α-diversity). Additionally, we found significant differences in macrofungal species richness depending on study area and type of forest management, which did not, however, derogate the effect of AFS. Spatial congruence between species composition of AFS and macrofungi communities (β-diversity) increased with forest age and decreased with intensity of forest management. If we consider the simplicity of monitoring AFS in comparison to regular monitoring of macrofungi, we found a widely usable tool for estimating macrofungal diversity in all dominant types of managed forest in central Europe. However, we should be aware of the limited ability of AFS to capture macrofungal diversity across a broader spatial context (γ-diversity), especially in areas with a low diversity of AFS.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","","10.1007/s10531-014-0701-y","wos:000338237500010","2-s2.0-84903212569","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0233447","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the discretized algebraic problems are not solved exactly, a natural question is whether the spatial distribution of the algebraic error is analogous to the spatial distribution of the discretization error. The main goal of this paper is to illustrate using standard boundary value model problems that this may not hold. On the contrary, the algebraic error can have large local components which can significantly dominate the total error in some parts of the domain. The illustrated phenomenon is of general significance and it is not restricted to some particular problems or dimensions. To our knowledge, the discrepancy between the spatial distribution of the discretization and algebraic errors has not been studied in detail elsewhere.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","1","10.1016/j.laa.2014.02.009","wos:000336699600008","2-s2.0-84897676626","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0233442","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Via a reduction to the extension problem of maps into a sphere, we particularly show that this problem is decidable in polynomial time for every fixed n, assuming dim K <= 2n−3. This is a substantial extension of previous computational applications of topological degree and related concepts in numerical and interval analysis. Via a reverse reduction we prove that the problem is undecidable when dim K >= 2n−2, where the threshold comes from the stable range in homotopy theory. For the lucidity of our exposition, we focus on the setting when f is piecewise linear. Such functions can approximate general continuous functions, and thus we get approximation schemes and undecidability of the robust satisfiability in other possible settings.","","","IN","UT WOS nezjištěno","hodui2015 *** ISBN: 978-1-61197-338-9 *** eISBN: 978-1-61197-340-2","SODA 2014.

This is parallel to the Big Bang of the Universe which expands and the speed of the expansion is the larger the farther the object is, and the expansion is isotropic. We observed another expansion in data embedded in metric space. We found that when distances in data space are polynomially expanded with a proper exponent, the space around any data point displays similar growth that is the larger the larger is the distance. We describe this phenomenon here on the basis of decomposition of the correlation integral. We show that the linear rule holds for logarithm of distance from any data point to another and proportionality constant is the scaling exponent, especially the correlation dimension. After this transformation of distances the data space appears as locally uniform and isotropic.","","","BB","","CD ROM","ICCTIM 2014.

In the simplest approach, a given real-world system is represented by an undirected graph composed of nodes standing for the subsystems and non-oriented unweighted edges for interactions present among the nodes; the characteristic properties of the graph are subsequently studied and related to the system’s behaviour. More detailed graph models may include edge weights, orientations or multiple types of links; potential time-dependency of edges is conveniently captured in so-called evolving networks. Recently, it has been shown that an evolving climate network can be used to disentangle different types of El Niño episodes described in the literature. The time evolution of several graph characteristics has been compared with the intervals of El Niño and La Niña episodes. In this study we identify the sources of the evolving network characteristics by considering a reduced-dimensionality description of the climate system using network nodes given by rotated principal component analysis. The time evolution of structures in local intra-component networks is studied and compared to evolving inter-component connectivity.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","1","10.5194/npg-21-451-2014","wos:000335376200010","2-s2.0-84897999720","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0233149","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: The EWMA model was designed for NT quality review using simulation. The NT measurements obtained during routine first-trimester screening in our centre over a two-and-a-half-year period were retrieved from the database. The NT distribution parameters, EWMA and CUSUM chart were established, and the methods were compared. Results: On the basis of the results from the simulation, the optimal EWMA settings were established. A set of 9338 NT measurements obtained from nine sonographers was used to construct the EWMA and CUSUM charts and to calculate the distribution parameters. Distribution-based methods were unable to reveal the temporal periods of poor performance. The EWMA model agreed closely with the CUSUM but had the advantage promptly indicating when the process returned to an in-control state, thus extending its use to long-term prospective and retrospective quality assessments. Conclusions: The EWMA provides a universal, easy and efficient tool for NT quality review when the prompt and effective detection of suboptimal performance is desired.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","","10.1002/pd.4314","wos:000334443000010","2-s2.0-84897393749","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0233136","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We are interested in several statistical analyses such as 1) finding differentially expressed genes between or among several experimental groups, 2) finding a small number of genes allowing for the correct classification of a sample in a certain group, and 3) finding relations among genes. Objectives: Gene expression data are high dimensional, and this fact complicates their analysis because we are able to perform only a few samples (e.g. the peripheral blood from a limited number of patients) for a certain set of thousands of genes. The main purpose of this paper is to present the shrinkage estimator and show its application in different statistical analyses. Methods: The shrinkage approach relates to the shift of a certain value of a classic estimator towards a certain value of a specified target estimator. More precisely, the shrinkage estimator is the weighted average of the classic estimator and the target estimator. Results: The benefit of the shrinkage estimator is that it improves the mean squared error (MSE) as compared to a classic estimator. The MSE combines the measure of an estimator’s bias away from its true unknown value and the measure of the estimator’s variability. The shrinkage estimator is a biased estimator but has a lower variability. Conclusions: The shrinkage estimator can be considered as a promising estimator for analyzing high dimensional gene expression data.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2015","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0232950","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

This study explores genetic predisposition of acute myocardial infarction in the Czech population. Methods and Results: Genome-wide expression study used matched case-control design. Peripheral blood samples of the controls were matched to those of cases based on gender, age, status of diabetes mellitus and smoking status. Six months cardiovascular survival status of the cases was used to identify two distinct subgroups among the cases. Linear models for microarray data were employed to identify differential gene expression. Shrunken centroids technique helped in identifying the subsets of differentially expressed genes with predictive properties in independent samples. Predictive properties were evaluated using bootstrap sampling. Sixty transcripts were found to be both clinically and statistically differentially expressed among the cases not surviving the six months follow-up period relative to controls, while no such transcripts were observed among other surviving cases. The two subgroups of cases exhibited fourteen differentially expressed transcripts. Predictive modeling indicated sixteen out of sixty transcripts to best discriminate between the controls and cases that died during the follow-up period from cardiovascular causes, while for the surviving cases the already non-significant set of transcripts could not be further reduced. Eleven out of fourteen transcripts were found to best discriminate between the two groups of cases using shrunken centroids. Conclusions: The study identified genes associated with excess genetic risk of acute myocardial infarction, including those associated with the six months fatality of the cases.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2015","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0232948","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Proc. 6th AISB Symp. on Computing and Philosophy: The Scandal of Computation - What is Computation?, AISB Convention 2013 (Exeter, UK), AISB, 2013, pp. 6-10] stating that computation is a process of knowledge generation. We give two conditions for a process to be computational, i.e. to be a knowledge generating process. First, the epistemic domain in which the computation is carried out must be known, and second, there must be evidence that the generated knowledge is indeed derivable within the underlying domain of discourse by the rules governing the domain and the underlying computational mechanism. The fulfillment of these conditions may be decided by an observer which, again, is modeled as a computational process according to our definition. As a consequence, our definition of computation is observer-relative. The viability of our definition is scrutinized by several examples of computations considered widely in the literature. Among them, we consider the question whether a rock can compute as well as some aspects of Searle’s Chinese room thought experiment. The examples illustrate that the epistemic approach to computation brings valuable new insight into the nature of computation and helps to resolve some classical problems related to these examples.","","","IN","","","AISB Symposium on Computing and Philosophy: Is Computation Observer-Relative? /7./.

We investigate the eigenvalues of these unitary matrices in relation to the convergence behavior of GMRES for the pair (A, b) and describe the indispensable role of the eigenvector information.

Existence and uniqueness of a TLS solution for such problems was analyzed in the paper [I. Hnětynková et al., SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 32, 2011, pp. 748--770]. For TLS problems with single right-hand sides the paper [C. C. Paige and Z. Strakoš, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 27, 2006, pp. 861--875] showed how necessary and sufficient information for solving $Ax/approx b$ can be revealed from the original data through the so-called core problem concept. In this paper we present a theoretical study extending this concept to problems with multiple right-hand sides. The data reduction we present here is based on the singular value decomposition of the system matrix $A$. We show minimality of the reduced problem; in this sense the situation is analogous to the single right-hand side case. Some other properties of the core problem, however, cannot be extended to the case of multiple right-hand sides.","","","BA","","hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2014","1","10.1137/120884237","wos:000325092700004","2-s2.0-84887388529","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0232296","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We analysed some genetic and proteomic aspects that could play an important role in the development of myocardial infarction. Matrix metalloproteinases are enzymes that contribute strongly to the degradation of extracellular matrix components. In this study the serological levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were investigated using immunological testing in 34 patients with myocardial infarction and 34 matched control subjects. The serum levels of MMPs were determined by ELISA. Changes in serum levels were characterized within 24 h and after 6 months post myocardial infarction. Significantly higher levels of MMP-2 (299.47 +/- 117.61 ng/ml) and MMP-9 (93.56 +/- 53.74 ng/ml) were determined in patients with myocardial infarction compared to the controls, in both cases P < 0.001. MMP-9 levels decreased significantly in the 6 months after cardiac event, whereas the levels of MMP-2 were almost equal to the post-infarction ones. While comparing the results from four patients that died of cardiovascular cause within 6 months we found significantly higher MMP-2 (435.00 +/- 55.83 ng/ml, P = 0.003) and MMP-9 (166.25 +/- 41.07 ng/ml, P = 0.018) values. Microarray analysis was used to determine the gene expression of selected genes for MMPs and their regulators from peripheral blood. The selected genes did not show satisfactory results that could have a potential implication for diagnostics of tissue degeneration.","","","FA","DOI nezjištěno","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2014","","","wos:000327577300002","2-s2.0-84907186252","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0231749","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Detailed knowledge about function these are necessary for clinical application of temporomandibular joint prosthesis and also help us estimate the lifetime of the prosthesis a possibilities of alteration in the contra lateral joint components. The mathematical model of TMJ with replacement is based on the theory of semi-coercive unilateral contact problems in linear elasticity and on finite element approximation.

However, several sources of uncertainty need to be considered when handling data. Bayesian mixing models provide a natural platform to handle diverse sources of uncertainty while allowing the user to contribute with prior expert information. The Bayesian mixing model FRUITS (Food Reconstruction Using Isotopic Transferred Signals) was developed for use in diet reconstruction studies. FRUITS incorporates the capability to account for dietary routing, that is, the contribution of different food fractions (e.g. macronutrients) towards a dietary proxy signal measured in the consumer. FRUITS also provides relatively straightforward means for the introduction of prior information on the relative dietary contributions of food groups or food fractions. This type of prior may originate, for instance, from physiological or metabolic studies. FRUITS performance was tested using simulated data and data from a published controlled animal feeding experiment. The feeding experiment data was selected to exemplify the application of the novel capabilities incorporated into FRUITS but also to illustrate some of the aspects that need to be considered when handling data within diet reconstruction studies. FRUITS accurately predicted dietary intakes, and more precise estimates were obtained for dietary scenarios in which expert prior information was included. FRUITS represents a useful tool to achieve accurate and precise food intake estimates in diet reconstruction studies within different scientific fields (e.g. ecology, forensics, archaeology, and dietary physiology).","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2014","","10.1371/journal.pone.0087436","wos:000331266000014","2-s2.0-84895835496","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0231232","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The methodology uses known characteristics of transmission conductors, along with load and weather data, to determine time series of conductor temperatures and corresponding thermal aging. Weather conditions can be obtained with high resolution, providing environmental conditions virtually at every point of a transmission system. This novel approach provides a complete spatiotemporal view of the thermal state of the system, bringing a whole new dimension to the research of thermal aging. All described types of aging analysis are important for effective transmission asset management, for scheduling of line maintenance or inspections, and for planning future transmission systems.

We derive two necessary and sufficient conditions for a 2-functor T to admit a functorial relation lifting: one is the existence of a distributive law of T over the “powerset monad” on categories, one is the preservation by T of “exactness” of certain squares. Both characterisations are generalisations of the “classical” results known for set functors: the first characterisation generalises the existence of a distributive law over the genuine powerset monad, the second generalises preservation of weak pullbacks. The results presented in this paper enable us to compute predicate liftings of endofunctors of, for example, generalised (ultra)metric spaces. We illustrate this by studying the coalgebraic cover modality in this setting.","","","BA","","hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2014","","10.2168/LMCS-9(4:8)2013","wos:000329566000006","2-s2.0-84885962039","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0230931","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Radiometric data measured at 15 s lag during 2010 in Timisoara (Romania) are used to illustrate their real-world performance. The models are useful for short term forecasting related e.g. to photovoltaic conversion control, including more complicated events like ramp-like switches between overcast and clear regimes. Importantly, presented models are not black-box forecasting tools.

Common methods for classifier combining can be further improved by using dynamic classification confidence measures which adapt to the currently classified pattern. However, in the case of dynamic classifier systems, the classification confidence measures need to be studied in a broader context as we show in this paper, the degree of consensus of the whole classifier team plays a key role in the process. We discuss the properties which should hold for a good confidence measure, and we define two methods for predicting the feasibility of a given classification confidence measure to a given classifier team and given data. Experimental results on 6 artificial and 20 real-world benchmark datasets show that for both methods, there is a statistically significant correlation between the feasibility of the measure, and the actual improvement in classification accuracy of the whole classifier system; therefore, both feasibility measures can be used in practical applications to choose an optimal classification confidence measure.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2014","","10.14311/NNW.2013.23.019","wos:000325193300003","2-s2.0-84885585402","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0229862","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Since, in practice, well-designed hybrid systems are usually robust, this implies that the algorithm terminates for the cases occurring in practice.

It implements a limited memory approach that exploits ideas from the positive semidefinite Tismenetsky-Kaporin modification scheme and, through the incorporation of intermediate memory, is a generalization of the widely-used ICFS algorithm of Lin and Moré. Both the density of the incomplete factor and the amount of memory used in its computation are under the user’s control. The performance of HSL MI28 is demonstrated using extensive numerical experiments involving a large set of test problems arising from a wide range of real-world applications. The numerical experiments are used to isolate the effects of scaling, ordering and dropping strategies so as to assess their usefulness in the development of robust algebraic incomplete factorization preconditioners and to select default settings for HSL MI28. They also illustrate the significant advantage of employing a modest amount of intermediate memory. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that, with limited memory, high quality yet sparse general-purpose preconditioners are obtained. Comparisons are made with ICFS, with a level-based incomplete factorization code and, finally, with a state-of-the-art direct solver.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","","10.1145/2617555","wos:000339622700001","2-s2.0-84904109881","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0228782","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Correlation dimension and other measures of effective dimensionality are used for characterization of data in applications. A direct use of correlation dimension to multidimensional data classification has not been hitherto presented. There are observations that the correlation integral is a distribution function of distances between all pairs of data points, and that by using polynomial expansion of distance with exponent equal to the correlation dimension this distribution is transformed into locally uniform. The classifier is based on consideration that the ""influence"" of neighbor points of some class on the probability that the query point belongs to this class is inversely proportional to its distance to the correlation dimension - power. New classification approach is based on summing up all these influences for each class. We prove that a resulting formula gives an estimate of probability of class - not a measure of membership to a class only - to which the query point belongs. For this assertion to be valid it is necessary that exponent of the polynomial transformation must be the correlation dimension. We also propose an ""averaging approach"" that speeds up computation of the correlation dimension especially for large data sets. It is demonstrated that the correlation dimension based classifier can outperform more sophisticated classifiers.","","","BB","","hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2305697","wos:000345629000002","2-s2.0-84911928407","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0228199","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Objectives: We present a detailed description of multilevel logistic regression applied in the derivation of the conclusion described in the Background, namely we compare multilevel logistic regression with logistic regression. Methods: The above mentioned clinical findings have been derived on the basis of data from the three-year (7/2008-6/2011) registry of acute coronary syndromes ALERT-CZ (Acute coronary syndromes – Longitudinal Evaluation of Real-life Treatment in non-PCI hospitals in the Czech Republic). A total of 32 hospitals contributed into the registry. The number of patients with ACS (n=6013) in the hospitals varied from 15 to 827. Results: The likelihood ratio test showed that the independence of medical outcomes across hospitals cannot be assumed (p<0.001, the variance partition coefficient VPC=8.9%). For this reason, we chose multilevel logistic regression to analyse data, specifically logistic mixed regression (the hospital identity was a random effect). The calibration properties of this model were very good (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, p=0.989). The total discriminant ability of the model was 91.8%. Conclusions: Considering some differences among hospitals, it was appropriate to take into account patient affiliation to various hospitals and to use multilevel logistic regression instead of logistic regression.","","","IN","","hodui2015 reissigová","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2014","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0227412","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Two binary variables may be used to quantify this process: the sunshine number (SSN) and the sunshine stability number (SSSN). The sequential features of SSN are treated in this paper by using Markovian Logistic Regression models, which avoid usual weaknesses of autoregressive integrated moving average modeling. The theory is illustrated with results obtained by using measurements performed in 2010 at Timisoara (southern Europe). Simple modeling taking into account internal dynamics with one lag history brings substantial reduction of misclassification compared with the persistence approach (to less than 57%). When longer history is considered, all the lags up to at least 8 are important. The seasonal changes are rather concentrated to low lags. Better performance is associated with a more stable radiative regime. More involved models add external influences (such as sun elevation angle or astronomic declination as well as taking into account morning and afternoon effects separately). Models including sun elevation effects are significantly better than those ignoring them. Clearly, during the winter months, the effect of declination is much more pronounced compared with the rest of the year. SSSN is important in long-term considerations and it also plays a role in retrospective assessment of the SSN. However, it is not easy to use SSSN for predicting future SSN. Using more complicated past beam clearness models does not necessarily provide better results than more simple models with SSN past.","","","BB","","hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","","10.1080/02664763.2013.862221","wos:000334073100002","2-s2.0-84897976558","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0227348","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper overviews some results of numerical linear algebra on the numerical stability of methods for the computation of these decompositions.

Under the assumption of nonzero principal minors of the matrix $M=B^T A B$ we give bounds for the conditioning of the triangular factor $R$ in terms of extremal singular values of $M$ and of only those principal submatrices of $M$ where there is a change of sign in $\\Omega$. Using these results we study the numerical behavior of two types of orthogonalization schemes and we give the worst-case bounds for quantities computed in finite precision arithmetic. In particular, we analyze the implementation based on the Cholesky-like factorization of $M$ and the Gram--Schmidt process with respect to the bilinear form induced by the matrix $A$. To improve the accuracy of computed results we consider also the Gram--Schmidt process with reorthogonalization and show that its behavior is similar to the scheme based on the Cholesky-like factorization with one step of iterative refinement.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2015","2016","","10.1137/130947003","wos:000357407800019","2-s2.0-84936754616","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0226707","RVO:67985807","1","","","","","","","","","",""

Upshot: We challenge the authors’ claim in the target article that ""departing from cognitivism requires the development of a new functional framework that will support causal, powerful and goal-directed behavior in the context of the interaction between the organism and the environment."" We argue that rather than a departure from cognitivism, the indicated goal is a natural complement or extension of the classical understanding of cognitivism. In order to reach such a goal, no new functional framework has to be developed right from scratch: there are many insights in related areas of research that can serve such a purpose well and can become an integral part of constructive cognitivism. We welcome the idea to build constructive foundations of cognitivism.","","","IN","","Hodnocení výsledků výzkumných organizací v roce 2014: Výsledky navržené k vyřazení – Tabulka č. 4 *** Článek má v databázi WoS uveden jiný příznak než „Article“, „Review“, „Proceedings Paper“ nebo „Letter“ *** http://www.isvav.cz/h14/resultDetail.do?rowId=RIV%2F67985807%3A_____%2F13%3A00398995!RIV14-AV0-67985807","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","","2013","2014","","","wos:000327330900011","2-s2.0-84892558824","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0226391","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

To identify individual source contribution into EEG recorded during the training, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was employed. Those independent components, for which the BCI system classification accuracy was at maximum, were treated as relevant to performing the motor imagery tasks. To reveal neurophysiological nature of these components we solved the inverse EEG problem in order to localize the sources of brain activity causing these components to appear in EEG. Individual geometry of brain and its covers provided by anatomical MR images, was taken into account when localizing the sources.

We monitored the extent of road mortality and related behavioral characteristics. A large number of snakes regularly inhabited the road's embankment during monitoring in June and September. Some individuals were observed to stay in exactly the same spot continuously for several consecutive days. Snakes were active starting between 0800 and 0900 h in the morning and ending by 1900 h in June and 1800 h in September. Activity was greatest during the morning. The most frequent type of observed behavior was related to thermoregulation. The snakes did not react visibly to passing traffic. The Aesculapian Snakes' activity was higher, and started at lower temperatures, in June than in September. The mean body temperature of the Aesculapian Snakes was 24.3 degrees of Celsius. On average, it was higher than the ambient air temperature until the ambient air temperature exceeded 27.8 degrees of Celsius. We detected very little road mortality of adult snakes. Even though they used the road embankments and adjacent stone abutment walls frequently, they virtually never ventured onto the surface of the road. To cross the road they generally used the culverts under it. Juvenile snakes ventured onto the road frequently and their road mortality was high.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","","10.1670/12-090","wos:000333777300005","2-s2.0-84897087562","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0226010","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Sunshine number has been proposed earlier to describe sunshine time series in qualitative terms (Theor Appl Climatol 72 (2002) 127-136) and it was shown to be useful both for theoretical and practical purposes, e.g. those related to the photovoltaic energy production. Statistical modeling and prediction of SSN as a binary time series has been challenging problem, however. Our statistical model for SSN time series is based on an underlying stochastic process formulation of Markov chain type. We will show how its transition probabilities can be efficiently estimated within logistic regression framework. In fact our logistic Markovian model can be fitted via maximum likelihood approach. This is optimal in many respects and it also enables us to use formalized statistical inference theory to obtain not only the point estimates of transition probabilities and their functions of interest but also related uncertainties as well as to test of various hypotheses. It is straightforward to deal with non-homogeneous transition probabilities in this framework. Very importantly, logistic Markov model class allows us to test hypotheses about how SSN dependents on various external covariates (e.g. elevation angle solar time etc.) and about details of the dynamic model (order and functional shape of the Markov kernel etc.). Therefore using generalized additive model approach (GAM), we can fit and compare models of various complexity which insist on keeping physical interpretation of the statistical model and its parts. After introducing the Markovian model and general approach for identification of its parameters we will illustrate its use and performance on high resolution SSN data from the Solar Radiation Monitoring Station of the West University of Timisoara.","","","BB","","","TIM 2012 Physics Conference.

This may involve an abnormality in the process of extracellular matrix remodelling. The present study evaluated the serum levels of specific metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and investigated the gene for transforming growth factor receptor 2 (TGFBR2) in 28 patients with AVD associated with AAD (mean age 60.6 years), in 29 patients (68.9 years) with AVD without AAD, and in 30 healthy controls (45.3 years). The serum levels of MMPs were determined by ELISA. Further, we focused on genetic screening of the TGFBR2 gene. Plasma MMP-2 concentrations were significantly higher in the groups of patients compared to the controls: median 1315.0 (mean 1265.2 +/- SD 391.3) in AVD with AAD, 1240.0 (1327.8 +/- 352.5) in AVD without AAD versus 902.5 (872.3 +/- 166.2) ng/ml in the healthy controls, in both cases P < 0.001. The serum levels of MMP-9 were significantly higher in AVD with AAD patients [107.0 (202.3 +/- 313.0)] and in AVD without AAD patients [107.0 (185.8 +/- 264.3)] compared to the healthy controls [14.5 (21.2 +/- 24.8) ng/ml], in both cases P < 0.001. No significant correlation was observed between plasma MMP-2 and MMP-9 and ascending aorta diameter. Genetic screening did not reveal any variation in the TGFBR2 gene in the patients. Measurement of MMP levels is a simple and relatively rapid laboratory test that could be used as a biochemical indicator when evaluated in combination with imaging techniques.","","","FA","DOI nezjištěno","hodui2015 reissigová","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2014","1","","wos:000326215400003","2-s2.0-84888594776","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0225158","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The talk will discuss advantages and limitations of networks with these two types of computational units. Higher flexibility in choice of free parameters in RBF will be compared with benefits of geometrical properties of kernel models allowing applications of maximal margin classification algorithms, modelling of generalization in learning from data in terms of regularization, and characterization of optimal solutions of learning tasks. Critical influence of input dimension on behavior of these two types of networks will be described. General results will be illustrated by the paradigmatic examples of Gaussian kernel and radial networks.","","","IN","invited paper","","MENDEL 2013. International Conference on Soft Computing /19./.

The approach is compared to a similar one with a single global meta-model as well as to more traditional NSGA-II and epsilon-IBEA.

Fitting copulas to multidimensional data is an increasingly important method for analyzing dependencies, and the new quantifiers of observational logic assess the possibility to describe the data by a hierarchical Archimedean copula with given properties. To this end, basic concepts pertaining to copulas, Archimedean copulas and hierarchical Archimedean copulas are first recalled, together with those properties that will be needed for the definition of the new quantifiers. Since the result of assessing the possibility to describe the data by a copula depends not only on the properties of that copula, but also on the precise algorithm for fitting it to the data, we present the algorithm we have used to this end, before finally defining the new quantifiers. The paper concludes with a brief illustration of applying the proposed quantifiers to the well-known Iris data set.","","","IN","","UT ISI","ITAT 2013.

There are described classes of functions which cannot be tractably represented by Heaviside perceptron networks in the sense that all their representations by such networks require numbers of units or sizes of output weights depending exponentially on the number of variables d. It is shown that the concept of variational norm from approximation theory can play a role of a measure of such tractability. Existence of large sets of Boolean functions with variations depending on d exponentially is proven. The results are illustrated by an example of a class of Boolean functions defined in terms of their communication matrices.","","","IN","","UT ISI","ITAT 2013.

According to four types of conflicting sets, four variants of plausibility conflict are defined. Further, a new alternative approach - pignistic conflict - based on pignistic probability instead of on normalized plausibility of singletons is introduced. Its cautious version may be considered to be an improvement of Liu’s degree of conflict cf.

One model (based on artificial mirror neurons) is used for mining and capturing the syntax of the recognized part of the environment while the second one (based on neural nets) for its semantics.

We examined variability in species richness and composition of the herbaceous layer in 229 plots located in 23 forest fragments (0.1 to 255 ha), in relation to the most important site environmental factors, edge effects, and site history. The influence of environmental factors on the composition of vegetation in the herb layer was evaluated using generalized additive models, which enabled us to analyze highly non-linear and non-monotonic relationships. Total species richness and number of red-listed and ancient forest species were significantly influenced by type of forest vegetation, light quality, soil pH, slope aspect, and distance from the forest edge. Implications of the significant explanatory variables corresponded well to previous findings, with the exception of distance from the forest edge, for which we found a positive relationship with species richness for distances up to 200 m toward the forest interior. Plant species with low colonization ability occupied plots with increasing frequency from edge to forest interior, while fast-colonizing species showed the opposite trend. Apart from the edge effect, forest continuity should be considered for its important contribution to the richness of ancient forest and red-listed species, whereas the effect of forest fragment size appeared to be generally weak. These results do not negate the importance of large forest fragments for the maintenance of herb layer species richness, but specifically emphasize the essential contribution of the core habitats of these forests.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2014","","10.1016/j.ppees.2013.08.004","wos:000329269800001","2-s2.0-84888056538","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0223832","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Because the data analysis component of decision support systems often happens to be unsuitable for high-dimensional data, special attention must be paid to the sophisticated selection of the most relevant variables before learning the classification rule. Methods: We implemented a prototype of a diagnostic  decision support system called SIR. The system has the ability to select the most relevant variables based on a set of high-dimensional measurements by means of a forward procedure optimizing a decision-making criterion. This allows  to learn a reliable classification rule. Results: The implemented prototype was tested on a sample of patients involved in a cardiology study. We used SIR to perform an information extraction from a cardiological clinical study containing both clinical and gene expression data. The classification performance was evaluated by means of a cross validation study. Conclusions: The proposed classification system can be useful for clinicians in primary care to support their decision-making tasks with relevant information extracted from any available clinical study. It is especially suitable for analyzing high-dimensional data, e.g. gene expression measurements.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2014","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0223270","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

This measure is inspired by the fact that biological neurons require more energy to transmit a spike than not to fire, and the activity of neurons in the brain is quite sparse, with only about 1% of neurons firing. In this paper, we investigate the energy complexity of recurrent networks which counts the number of active neurons at any time instant of a computation. We prove that any deterministic finite automaton with m states can be simulated by a neural network of optimal size s=\\Theta(\\sqrt{m}) with the time overhead of \\tau=O(s/e) per one input bit, using the energy O(e), for any e such that e=\\Omega(\\log s) and e=O(s), which shows the time-energy tradeoff in recurrent networks. In addition, for the time overhead \\tau satisfying \\tau^\\tau=o(s), we obtain the lower bound of s^{c/\\tau} on the energy of such a simulation, for some constant c>0 and for infinitely many s.","","","IN","","hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","","10.1162/NECO_a_00579","wos:000334027800005","2-s2.0-84897975813","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0222343","RVO:67985807","1;0","","","","","","","","","",""

The  non-emptiness of core is completely characterized in terms of balanced systems and by the presence of strong veto players.","","","BA","DOI nezjištěno","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2014","","","wos:000322858500003","2-s2.0-84881304978","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0222591","RVO:67985807","1","","","","","","","","","",""

We apply this method to two new so-called distance and buffer complexity measures for Turing machine computations. These measures are sensitive to long-distance transfers of information on the worktape and they prove to be mutually related. In particular, the buffer complexity counts the number of necessary block uploads into a virtual double-block buffer of the worktape which is divided into blocks. Thus, they can be used for investigating the buffering aspects of Turing computations. We start this study by proving a tight separation which shows that a very small increase in the buffer (or distance) complexity bound (roughly from f(n) to f(n+1)) brings provably more computational power to both deterministic and nondeterministic Turing machines even for unary languages. We also obtain hierarchies of the distance and buffer complexity classes.","","","IN","","inprint","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","","2017","2018","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0221961","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Such dynamical complex systems can be represented by a directed graph, where each link denotes an existence of a causal relation, or information exchange between the nodes. For geophysical systems such as global climate, these relations are commonly not theoretically known but estimated from recorded data using causality analysis methods. These include bivariate nonlinear methods based on information theory and their linear counterpart. The trade-off between the valuable sensitivity of nonlinear methods to more general interactions and the potentially higher numerical reliability of linear methods may affect inference regarding structure and variability of climate networks. We investigate the reliability of directed climate networks detected by selected methods and parameter settings, using a stationarized model of dimensionality-reduced surface air temperature data from reanalysis of 60-year global climate records. Overall, all studied bivariate causality methods provided reproducible estimates of climate causality networks, with the linear approximation showing higher reliability than the investigated nonlinear methods. On the example dataset, optimizing the investigated nonlinear methods with respect to reliability increased the similarity of the detected networks to their linear counterparts, supporting the particular hypothesis of the near-linearity of the surface air temperature reanalysis data.","","","BB","","hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2014","10","10.3390/e15062023","wos:000320773000005","2-s2.0-84880002507","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0221829","RVO:67985807","0;1","","","","","","","","","",""

The choice of dependence measure is key for the results of the subsequent analysis and interpretation. The use of linear Pearson’s correlation coefficient is widespread and convenient. On the other side, as the climate is widely acknowledged to be a nonlinear system, nonlinear dependence quantification methods, such as those based on information-theoretical concepts, are increasingly used for this purpose. In this paper we outline an approach that enables well informed choice of dependence measure for a given type of data, improving the subsequent interpretation of the results. The presented multi-step approach includes statistical testing, quantification of the specific non-linear contribution to the interaction information, localization of areas with strongest nonlinear contribution and assessment of the role of specific temporal patterns, including signal nonstationarities. In detail we study the consequences of the choice of a general nonlinear dependence measure, namely mutual information, focusing on its relevance and potential alterations in the discovered dependence structure. We document the method by applying it to monthly mean temperature data from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis dataset as well as the ERA dataset. We have been able to identify main sources of observed non-linearity in inter-node couplings. Detailed analysis suggested an important role of several sources of nonstationarity within the climate data. The quantitative role of genuine nonlinear coupling at monthly scale has proven to be almost negligible, providing quantitative support for the use of linear methods for monthly temperature data.","","","BB","","excelent2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2014","2015","7","10.1007/s00382-013-1780-2","wos:000334068100011","2-s2.0-84897573038","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0221828","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigate the energy complexity for recurrent networks which bounds the number of active neurons at any time instant of a computation. We prove that any deterministic finite automaton with m states can be simulated by a neural network of optimal size s=Theta(sqrt{m}) with time overhead O(s/e) per one input bit, using the energy O(e), for any e=Omega(log s) and e=O(s), which shows the time-energy tradeoff in recurrent networks.","","","IN","","UTISI *** hodui2015","ICANN 2013.

The purpose of the present paper is to present first ideas leading to such a theory within the framework of a high-level model of an embodied cognitive agent. In order to support creativity an agent must have the ability to draw and understand analogies which may be used in its otherwise standard reasoning processes in place of facts that served as the basis of the analogy. The use of analogies may then lead to the derivation of new explanatory knowledge in form of conjectures that can further become a subject of criticism, testing and adjustment or rejection. In the respective creative processes embodiment plays an indispensable role. We show that the existing model of an embodied cognitive agent designed recently by the author can serve as an explanatory model elucidating the mechanisms of creativity. Technically, the process of drawing analogies and their use in derivations of explanations can be seen as a means of mining new knowledge originally rooted in the environment. This can boost the computational power of cognitive systems above that of the classical Turing systems.","","","IN","","vyšlo též na CD : Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI).

The sunshine number (SSN) is a Boolean quantity stating whether the sun is covered by clouds or not, thus being an appropriate parameter to predict the occurrence of direct solar radiation at ground level. Various ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) models for SSN nowcasting are inferred and discussed in this paper. Actinometric and meteorological data measured at 15 s lag during June 2010 in Timisoara (Romania) are used. The forecasting accuracy is studied as a function of season, of the procedure used to obtain a binary time series and of the type of white noise distribution, respectively. It is demonstrated that the ARIMA(0,1,0) model forecasts SSN with the same accuracy as higher order ARIMA models. The forecasting accuracy decreases when the instability of the radiative regime increases.","","","JE","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2014","1","10.1016/j.energy.2013.03.005","wos:000319371600010","2-s2.0-84876994889","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0220575","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Classification forests grown by the Random Forests method are used for classifying EEG segments, and distinguishing somnolence from other brain states. A novel approach to classifier (forest) construction is proposed: An individual model tailored for a single subject, using only the subject’s own data, may be combined with a global model trained on data of a number of different subjects. Combining is realized via a weighted average of votes for classes, where the weights result from a simple optimization procedure. A modification of OOB estimates was implemented in order to keep the misclassification error estimates unbiased.

The classifiers considered were complex models whose building blocks were classification forests constructed by the Random Forests method. Since the EEG signals are highly individual, it is necessary to tailor a separate classifier for each subject. Earlier studies have shown, however, that a model (classification forest) based exclusively on the subject's own data may be improved, when combined (through a weighted average of votes for classes) with a model derived from the data of a well selected subset S of other subjects. Different strategies of the search for a proper set S were experimentally compared and a “winning” strategy chosen. The starting point of the present study was a strange and undesirable behavior of the best models from the previous research stage, observed when the size of the forests (number of trees) was varied (originally, the default of 500 trees per forest was used): Some of the models deteriorated with the growing forest size. Such phenomena often result from an overfit due to a too extensive model search, but the tendency to overfit is not, as a rule, a property of the components of the models, i.e. of the forests. That has given rise to the hypothesis that combining bigger forest is more prone to overfit than that of the smaller ones. If so, the model search should be the more restricted (i.e. the number of candidate models kept smaller), the bigger forests are combined. The hypothesis is supported by a computational experiment whose results are reported: After applying restrictions to the size of set S (and to the values of some numerical parameters of the models, too), the trend of model deterioration with the growing forest size vanished or, at least, was considerably attenuated.","","","BB","","","ISI 2011.

Here we construct distribution-sensitive estimators based on the Hills procedure using score moment estimators for other heavy-tailed distributions (Pareto, Fréchet, Burr, log-gama, inverse gamma, etc.), and to study their statistical properties, both theoretically (e.g consistency, asymptotical distribution) and by means of simulation experiments (e.g. comparisons of exact effectiveness of our method for different heavy tailed distributions). A specific problem is finding of an optimal threshold k, say, yielding a trade off in between of variance and bias of the Hill estimator. Simulation results by Embrechts et al. (1997) showed that the Hill estimator and its alternatives work well over large ranges of values for k in the case of Pareto distribution. However, Hill estimator is often giving wrong results for distributions different from the Pareto one. Their ""Hill horror plots"" actually show deviations of the Hill estimates trending farther away from the true value of the tail index as k is increased. In this paper we illustrate t-Hill. We also quantify the robustness and compare efficiency with other competitors. The paper is organized as follows. First section is introduction. In section 2 we recall the theory of scalar score. In section 3 we discussed the t-Hill estimator, introduced firstly in Stehlík et al. (2011). The section 4 comparing t-Hill and Hill estimators follows. Therein contamination of underling data is controlled by means of score variance of Pareto distribution. Comparisons show that t-Hill estimator outperforms Hill estimator. In section 5 we introduce the t-Hill plot. We end with powers of selected tests for normality against Pareto distribution.","","","BB","","","ISI 2011.

The TMJ is a complex, sensitive and highly mobile joint which works bilaterally so each side influences the contralateral joint and because of this the distribution of the stresses is changed in the healthy joint as well. Detailed knowledge about function these are necessary for clinical application of temporomandibular joint prosthesis and also help us estimate the lifetime of the prosthesis a possibilities of alteration in the contra lateral joint components.

The quadratures are computed using the (1,1)-entry of the inverse of the corresponding Jacobi matrix (or its rank-one or rank-two modifications). The resulting algorithm called CGQL computes explicitly the entries of the Jacobi matrix and its modifications from the CG coefficients. In this paper, we use the fact that CG computes the Cholesky decomposition of the Jacobi matrix which is given implicitly. For Gauss-Radau and Gauss-Lobatto quadratures, instead of computing the entries of the modified Jacobi matrices, we directly compute the entries of the Cholesky decompositions of the (modified) Jacobi matrices. This leads to simpler formulas in comparison to those used in CGQL.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2013","2","10.1007/s11075-012-9591-9","wos:000314058700001","2-s2.0-84873129114","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0219082","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We exploit the exact  unconditional approach to propose alternative versions of some trend tests. One of them is the  test of relaxed trend (Liu, 1998), who proposed a generalization of the classical Cochran-  Armitage test of linear trend. A numerical example on real data reveals the advantages of the  test of relaxed trend compared to the classical test of linear trend. Further, we propose  an exact unconditional test also for modeling association between an ordinal response and  nominal regressor.

Safety verification for such systems thus needs to consider probabilistic variants of systems with hybrid dynamics. In safety verification of classical hybrid systems, we are interested in whether a certain set of unsafe system states can be reached from a set of initial states. In the probabilistic setting, we may ask instead whether the probability of reaching unsafe states is below some given threshold. In this paper, we consider probabilistic hybrid systems and develop a general abstraction technique for verifying probabilistic safety problems. This gives rise to the first mechanisable technique that can, in practice, formally verify safety properties of non-trivial continuous-time stochastic hybrid systems. Moreover, being based on abstractions computed by tools for the analysis of non-probabilistic hybrid systems, improvements in effectivity of such tools directly carry over to improvements in effectivity of the technique we describe. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on a number of case studies, tackled using a prototypical implementation.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","1","10.3166/EJC.18.572-587","wos:000314389900006","2-s2.0-84874590818","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0217724","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

These approaches assume that the observed high dimensional data are driven by a small number of hidden binary sources combined due to Boolean superposition. The first approach is the Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) and the second one is the Boolean factor analysis (BFA). The two BMF methods are used for comparison. First is the M8 method from the BMDP statistical software package and the second one is the method suggested by Belohlavek \\& Vychodil. These two are compared to BFA, especially with the Expectation-maximization Boolean Factor Analysis we had developed earlier has, however, been extended with a binarization step developed here. The well-known bars problem and the mushroom dataset are used for revealing the methods' peculiarities. In particular, the reconstruction ability of the computed factors and the information gain as the measure of dimension reduction was under scrutiny. It was shown that BFA slightly loses to BMF in performance when noise-free signals are analyzed. Conversely, BMF loses considerably to BFA when input signals are noisy.","","","IN","","hodui2015 řezanková","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","","10.14311/NNW.2012.22.035","wos:000314321300006","2-s2.0-84874915046","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0216965","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

As the maximization is more difficult than the minimization, we present here some theoretical results concerning the solution.

In such cases, surrogate models are used to reduce the number of fitness evaluations. Some of the problems also require a fixed size batch of solutions to be evaluated at a time. Traditional methods of selecting individuals for true evaluation to improve the surrogate model either require individual points to be evaluated, or couple the batch size with the EA generation size. We propose a queue based method for individual selection based on active learning of a kriging model. Individuals are selected using the confidence intervals predicted by the model, added to a queue and evaluated once the queue length reaches the batch size. The method was tested on several standard benchmark problems. Results show that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve a solution using significantly less evaluations of the true fitness function.

As a remedy, a new kind of fuzzy measures is proposed, called similarity-aware measures, and several useful properties of such measures are proven. Finally, results of extensive experiments on a number of benchmark datasets are reported, in which a particular similarity-aware measure was applied to a combination of Choquet or Sugeno integrals with three different ways of creating ensembles of classification rules. In the experiments, the new measure was compared with the traditional Sugeno-measure, to which it was clearly superior.","","","IN","","UT ISI","ITAT 2012.

We use the concept of conformal prediction (CP) to construct regions which satisfy given confidence level. Conformal prediction outputs regions, which are automatically valid, but their width and therefore usefulness depends on the used nonconformity measure. A nonconformity measure should tell us how different a given example is with respect to other examples. We de ne nonconformity measures based on some reliability estimates such as variance of a bagged model or local modeling of prediction error. We also present results of testing CP based on different nonconformity measures showing their usefulness and comparing them to traditional confidence intervals.","","","IN","","UT ISI","ITAT 2012.

In contrast to the most of  the surrogate models in the current literature, it can be directly used for problems with mixed continuous and discrete variables - clustering and generalized linear models are employed for dealing with discrete covariates.

The paper elaborates the initial study presented in previous papers and focuses mainly on parameterization of graded properties by conjunction-multiplicities of subformulae in the defining formulae, preservation of graded properties under compositions and slight variations of fuzzy connectives, the values of graded properties for basic connectives of the ground logic, and the dependence of the values on the ground logic. The results are proved in the formal framework of higher-order fuzzy logic MTL, also known as Fuzzy Class Theory (FCT).

The purpose of our study was to determine the association of natural menopause with cardiovascular risk factors, including their clustering into metabolic syndrome (MS). A random 5% representative population sample of women aged 45-54 years was examined. In 575 women, we were able to determine their natural reproductive aging status. Multiple regression analysis was used to calculate the association between age, menopausal status, and risk factors under study. After adjustment for age, there was an increase in the odds ratio of developing MS, as defined by NCEP (OR=2.0; 95% CI [1.1; 3.7]), and an increase in plasma lipid ratios (total cholesterol/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, apolipoprotein-B/apolipoprotein-A1; p<0.05 for all) in postmenopausal women. Age, but not menopausal status, was associated with some single components of MS; only waist circumference significantly increased after menopause, independently of age. Clustering of risk factors in MS and lipid ratios (combined factors) was strongly associated with menopause whereas worsening of single components of MS was strongly associated with age. In conclusion, based on our results, the menopause may pose a risk to women through clustering of cardiovascular risk factors beyond simple aging.","","","FB","DOI nezjištěno","/rozpor1/nejednotny_celkovy_pocet_tvurcu, /rozpor1/nejednotny_rok_uplatneni","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","4","","wos:000314138600004","2-s2.0-84873837499","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0213601","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We have added the possibility of determining the dropout probability into the second model, otherwise this model overestimates the probabilities calculated.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0213554","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Observation and modeling of CO2 concentrations and surface fluxes in regions with a high level of industrial activity are important for detecting and localizing ecosystem disturbances, and for evaluating results of reclamation and restoration efforts. A sophisticated modeling system can also be used to examine alternative development scenarios in such regions.  Mathematical models, based on our observation of the environment and its changes, can improve our understanding of natural processes in these ecosystems and how they are affected by human activities. In order to make effective use of such models, the role of mathematical modeling and its close relationship to observations must be well understood. Temporal and spatial patterns found through modeling serve as the underlying evidence upon which rules and mechanisms affecting the ecosystem can be deduced.","","","DG","","hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","","10.1017/CBO9781139059152.005","wos:000311807000004","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0213516","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

They are often built in remote areas without appropriate power grid connections. The construction of a new power transmission line or improving the old one requires significant financial and time costs. The grid operators prefer to limit the power production in order to keep the load of the power line under its rating. Instead of broadly-used static rating, the existing lines can be rated in real time using a dynamic thermal rating (DTR) system. DTR of power transmission lines can usually provide a significant increase of transmission capacity compared to the static rating. The main inputs to DTR systems are measured or forecast meteorological data. The relation of DTR to the renewable resources is obvious when we consider input parameters to the calculation scheme - wind speed, ambient temperature and shortwave radiation. Exactly same variables are determining production of wind and solar energy. A case study of virtual wind farm and corresponding power transmission line shows limits of renewable energy production at given site. The results demonstrate that the optimal size of wind farm is approximately triple when using DTR comparing to the static rating.","","","JE","","ISBN:  978-1-457-71830-4 Weitere Ausgaben: 978-1-4577-1828-1, 978-1-4577-1829-8   *** v IEEE je PrintISBN: 978-1-4577-1830-4 *** UT ISI","EEEIC 2012.

This was already noticed by Sugiura [Ann. Inst. Statist. Math. 17 (1965) 261–263]; he found an alternative against which the Wilcoxon test is not unbiased. The problem is even more serious in multivariate models. When testing the hypothesis against an alternative which fits well with the experiment, it should be verified whether the power of the test under this alternative cannot be smaller than the significance level. Surprisingly, this serious problem is not frequently considered in the literature. The present paper considers the two-sample multivariate testing problem. We construct several rank tests which are finite-sample unbiased against a broad class of location/scale alternatives and are finite-sample distribution-free under the hypothesis and alternatives. Each of them is locally most powerful against a specific alternative of the Lehmann type. Their powers against some alternatives are numerically compared with each other and with other rank and classical tests. The question of affine invariance of two-sample multivariate tests is also discussed.","","","BB","","hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","2","10.3150/10-BEJ326","wos:000300801000010","2-s2.0-84856595405","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0213418","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

An important special case of  this measure can be interpreted as a kind of buffering complexity which  counts the number of necessary block uploads into a virtual buffer on top  of worktape. Thus, the distance measure can be used for investigating  the buffering aspects of Turing computations. In this paper, we start this  study by proving a tight separation and hierarchy result. In particular,  we show that a very small increase in the distance complexity bound  (roughly from c(n) to c(n + 1) + constant) brings provably more computational  power to deterministic or nondeterministic Turing machines.  For this purpose, we formulate a very general diagonalization method  for Blum-like complexity measures. We also obtain a hierarchy of the  distance complexity classes.","","","IN","UT WOS nezjištěno","UT ISI *** hodui2015 žák","LATA 2013.

SOFA 2 is an advanced component framework providing a rich set of features including hierarchical architectures,  multiple communication styles, behavior specification, transparent distribution, etc. The framework  also introduces a well-defined development methodology supported by a rigorous component model and  rich set of tools enabling application design, deployment, and execution. Furthermore, SOFA 2 is suitable  for development of systems for multiple application domains. To allow this, SOFA 2 offers a concept of  “profiles”, which extend the core of the framework to be suitable for a particular domain. Currently, profiles  for Java, Java ME and embedded C-based systems exist, utilizing a common development methodology and  tooling.  This tutorial shows the SOFA 2 component framework and its ecosystem including tools for architecture  modeling, component implementation, deployment, execution, and runtime monitoring. Furthermore, it  demonstrates development workflow stressing the advanced features of the used component model.","","","JC","","Bureš neuvedeb jako domácí, ale podpořen grantem GD201/09/H057 MFF+UI - bez institucionální podpory","FESCA 2012.

Achieving resource awareness with clean separation of concerns and reasonable overhead is still a challenge — especially where this awareness concerns runtime performance. Among the difficult issues are for example transparent performance monitoring or platform independent performance evaluation. To advance the current state of the art in resource awareness, we propose a performance awareness framework for the domain of component-based systems. The framework is based on the Stochastic Performance Logic (SPL), which enables explicit description and automatic evaluation of assumptions about performance using logic formulas. We demonstrate the potential of the framework on multiple use-cases and outline extensions that facilitate the runtime resource awareness.","","","JC","","po dohode neni LB autor UI *** po dohode neni LB autor UI *** E-ISBN + copyright:  978-0-7695-4758-9, PrintISBN: 978-1-4673-2714-5","COMPSACW 2012.

Nevertheless, releasing the resources not needed in specific phases of system execution is only rarely supported by todays component frameworks, mainly since information about the system state is spread over several components, which makes the idea hard to implement. The paper introduces a formal model of property networks allowing for efficient capture of modifications of architecture-relevant information and shows, how this model can be used to employ the concept of modes for system architectures in hierarchical component systems.","","","JC","","UT ISI","CBSE 2012.

The problem to be addressed is two-fold: first, several domain-specific languages (DSL) are to be employed to express different element concerns (architecture, deployment context, code pattern) and second, porting to another general-purpose language should avoid modification of the specification and related code generation process as much as possible. In both respects, the classical template-based code generation technique proved to be inflexible, requiring the code generator to be blurred with ad hoc encoded DSL facets. The paper addresses the problem by introducing the concept of interoperable DSL family. Each member of the family is built around its core language, which can be further specialized by embedding into a target programming  language. Interoperability of these DSLs is achieved at the level of abstract syntax trees (ASTs) with help of queries. As a proof of the concept, we have implemented the queries via the AST transformation rules of the Stratego/XT framework. In the evaluation, we provide a comparison with the original template-based implementation, which clearly indicates the DSL family and AST transformation benefits. We also provide examples of application areas where the concept of interoperable DSL family can be employed (and also indicate how this can be accomplished).","","","JC","","po dohode neni FP autor UI","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2014","","10.1002/spe.2118","wos:000317690100001","2-s2.0-84876284058","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0212840","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

This stems from the dynamic nature of such systems, where components and their bindings may appear and disappear  without anticipation. To address this challenge, we propose employing separation of concerns via a mechanism of dynamic  implicit bindings with implicit communication. This way, we strive for dynamically formed, implicitly interacting groups – ensembles – of autonomous components. In this context, we  introduce the DEECo component model, where such bindings, as well as the associated communication, are managed in an automated way, enabling transparent handling of the dynamic changes in the system.","","","JC","","UT ISI *** po dohode nejsou JK a TB autory UI *** PrintISBN: 978-1-4673-2809-8","WICSA / ECSA 2012.

The performance of the methods is evaluated by means of information gain. Study of the results obtained in solving BP of different levels of complexity has allowed us to reveal strengths and weaknesses of these methods. It is shown that the Likelihood maximization Attractor Neural Network with Increasing Activity (LANNIA) is the most efficient BFA method in solving BP in many cases. Efficacy of the LANNIA method is also shown, when applied to the real data from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database, which contains full genome sequencing for 1368 organisms, and to text data set R52 (from Reuters 21578) typically used for label categorization.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2016","2016","","10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2412686","wos:000372022900004","2-s2.0-84926645435","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0212684","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Most epidemiological studies have assessed the effects of dietary intake only, although endogenous production after sun exposure is the main source of vitamin D. The aim of our pilot study was to study serum levels of vitamin D in general population and in patients with different type of cancer. Patients and Methods: The control group consisted of 214 healthy individuals. Pathological groups of patients included 170 patients with different cancer types (28 patients with prostate cancer, 43 patients with breast cancer, 49 patients with colorectal cancer and 50 patients with lung cancer). All of the patients were enrolled in the early clinical stage of cancer up to clinical stage III. Advanced stages were not included into the study. Vitamin D serum levels were measured using ECLIA Roche method. Results: All the results for serum vitamin D from pathological groups were significantly lower compared to the levels of the control group. All the cancer types had a high incidence rate of very low serum levels of vitamin D. Lung cancer had the highest incidence rate of very low vitamin D serum levels. Conclusion: We found a high incidence of hypovitaminosis D in cancer patients compared to a healthy control group among a Czech population. This incidence rate is higher in comparison to data found in literature from the other parts of the world. Based on the data from this study, a large epidemiological study monitoring vitamin D serum levels in the healthy population and in cancer patients in the Czech Republic has been already proposed.","","","FD","DOI nezjištěno","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2013","","","wos:000295667700072","2-s2.0-80054761307","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0212653","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

In a cohort of 59 patients (49 males, mean age 68.3 years, 36-88 years) after evacuation of subdural hematoma (SDH) were evaluated hypothalamo-pituitary functions one week after surgery, after three months and after one year.

We did not find any serious case of hypocortisolism, hypothyroidism, diabetes insipidus centralis nor syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH). Transient partial hypocortisolism was present in two cases, but resolved. We did not find relation between extension of SDH or clinical severity and development of hypopituitarism. In conclusion, in some patients with SDH growth hormone deficiency or hypogonadism was present. No serious hypocortisolism, hypothyroidism, diabetes insipidus nor SIADH was observed.

Starting from the idea of projections, Krylov subspace methods are characterised by their orthogonality and minimisation properties. Projections onto highly nonlinear Krylov subspaces can be linked with the underlying problem of moments. This allows enlightening reformulations of questions from matrix computations into the language of orthogonal polynomials, Gauss-Christoffel quadrature, continued fractions, and, more generally, of Vorobyev's method of moments. Using the concept of cyclic invariant subspaces, conditions are studied that allow the generation of orthogonal Krylov subspace bases via short recurrences. The results motivate the important practical distinction between Hermitian and non-Hermitian problems. Finally, the book thoroughly addresses the computational cost while using Krylov subspace methods. The investigation includes effects of finite precision arithmetic and focuses on the method of conjugate gradients (CG) and generalised minimal residuals (GMRES) as major examples. There is an emphasis on the way algebraic computations must always be considered in the context of solving real-world problems, where the mathematical modelling, discretisation and computation cannot be separated from each other. The book also underlines the importance of the historical context and demonstrates that knowledge of early developments can play an important role in understanding and resolving very recent computational problems. Many extensive historical notes are included as an inherent part of the text as well as the formulation of some omitted issues and challenges which need to be addressed in future work. This book is applicable to a wide variety of graduate courses on Krylov subspace methods and related subjects, as well as benefiting those interested in the history of mathematics.","","","BA","","hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2013","9","10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199655410.001.0001","","2-s2.0-84919676213","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0212555","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First one is Dunn’s coefficient which contains membership degrees in its computational formula; second one is the average silhouette width, used primarily for evaluating hard clustering. There have already been attempts to compare different coefficients for determining the clustering quality or number of clusters respectively. Unfortunately coefficients for evaluating hard clustering and for fuzzy clustering were studied separately only. We tested coefficients efficiency when clustering both data set consisting of generated objects with the known number of clusters and real data sets with unknown number of clusters. The analysis showed the limitations of these two coefficients especially for the cases when clusters are really fuzzy.","","","BB","","ISBN na copyright page 978-1-4673-4792-1 *** hodui2015 ezanková","CASoN 2012.

We estimate that sensitivities of mortality-related benefits to 10% NOx emissions reduction in major cities reach monetary values in excess of $630K/day in Europe and $270K/day in North America.

This problem has been studied intensively in the last decade and, as a result, geometric symmetries of triangular norms with involutive level sets have been revealed. The presented paper intends to introduce a different approach which gives more general results. The inspiration is taken from web geometry, a branch of differential geometry, and its concept of Reidemeister closure condition which is known to provide a geometric characterization of associativity of loops. The paper shows that this concept can be adopted successfully for triangular norms so that it characterizes their associativity in a similar way. Moreover, the offered adaptation preserves the beneficial transparency and simplicity of the Reidemeister closure condition. This way, a visual characterization of the associativity, based on the geometry of the level sets, is provided for general, continuous, and continuous Archimedean triangular norms.","","","BA","","hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","1","10.1016/j.fss.2012.01.008","wos:000306886100006","2-s2.0-84862166092","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0212099","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

As for the first family, four variants how to utilize the Strang recurrences for the Broyden class of variable metric updates are investigated; three of them use the same number of stored vectors as the limited- memory BFGS method. Moreover, one of the variants does not require any additional matrix by vector multiplication. The second family uses vectors from the preceding iteration to construct a new class of variable metric updates. Resulting methods again require neither any additional matrix by vector multiplication nor any additional stored vector.

Selected categorized attributes of MDMC had mostly different numbers of categories and used different terms in narrative and structured reports.

Folate status is a complex trait determined by both exogenous and endogenous factors. This study analyzed the association between 12 genetic variants and folate status in a Czech population with no folate fortification program. These 12 genetic variants were selected from 56 variant alleles found by resequencing the coding sequences and adjacent intronic regions of 6 candidate genes involved in folate metabolism or transport (FOLR1, FOLR2, FOLR3, MTHFR, PCFT, and RFC) from 29 individuals with low plasma and erythrocyte folate concentrations. Regression analyses of a cohort of 511 Czech controls not taking folate supplements revealed that only 2 variants in the MTHFR gene were associated with altered folate concentrations in plasma and/or erythrocytes. In our previous study, we observed that the common variant MTHFR c.665C > T (known as c.677C > T; p.A222V) was associated with decreased plasma folate concentrations. In the present study, we show in addition that the rare variant MTHFR c.1958C > T (p.T653M) is associated with significantly increased erythrocyte folate concentrations (P = 0.02). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that this uncommon variant, which is present in 2% of Czech control chromosomes, explains 0.9% of the total variability of erythrocyte folate concentrations; the magnitude of this effect size was comparable with that of the common MTHFR c.665C > T variant. This result indicates that the rare genetic variants may determine folate status to a similar extent as the common allelic variant. J.

Data mohou být využita ke statistickému vyhodnocení a jiným odborným, případně vědeckým účelům. Cíl: Cílem studie je ověřit jednoduchost ukládání dat a porovnání časové náročnosti tří metod záznamu dentálních údajů: zápis do modifikované WHO karty a dentální elektronický zdravotní záznam (EZZ) ovládaný klávesnicí nebo hlasem. Metody: Všechny tři metody byly použity u 126 pacientů. Stav chrupu zjištěný při klinickém vyšetření byl nejprve klasickým způsobem zapsán do WHO karty. Stejná osoba pak provedla záznam do EZZ za použití klávesnice nebo při ovládání hlasem. Poté jsme porovnávali dobu, potřebnou k uložení záznamu u všech tří metod. Užitím Friedmanova testu jsme nalezli signifikantní rozdíly časové náročnosti mezi třemi metodami (p <0,001). Ruční zápis do WHO karty byl proveden rychle, ale jeho opětovné použití je velmi obtížné, protože není v elektronické podobě. Rozdíl časové náročnosti záznamů vyšetření při použití EZZ ovládaného klávesnicí nebo hlasem nebyl signifikantní (Wilcoxonův párový test dosáhl hodnoty p = 0,09). Závěr: V klinické praxi je požadováno najít způsoby, jak se vyhnout ručnímu ovládání dentálního EZZ pomocí klávesnice, myši či dotykové obrazovky. Proto byl přidán automatický systém rozpoznání (ASR), aby umožnil zubnímu lékaři používání softwaru bez nutnosti dotykového ovládání. Tímto způsobem eliminujeme potřebu druhé osoby, která provádí zápis do počítače nebo nadbytečné hygienické úkony (mytí rukou, výměna rukavic atd.).","Introduction: The electronic health record (EHR) is a computerized health information system where provider record detailed encounter information such as patient demographics, encounter summaries, medical history allergies, intolerances, and lab test histories [9]. The EHR will be used in future diagnostic and treatment decision making. The decision is always taken by a physician or dentist. Medical documentation contains information about treatment, communication with insurance service system and statistical data evaluation. The EHR may support and improve future diagnostics and therapy in general. The data can be used in statistics and other scientific purposes. Aim: The aim of study is to verify the simplicity of data process implementation and time of data storing for modification of classical paper WHO dental card, lifetime dental EHR controlled by keyboard and lifetime dental EHR controlled by voice. Methods: All three methods were applied on 126 patients. The dental status of patients was examined and the data recorded in classical way into the paper WHO dental card. The same person recorded all data to lifetime dental EHR using keyboard and using voice. Then we compared the time, which was needed for recording the data using these three methods. Using Friedaman test we found very significant differences in time of recording among three methods (p<0.001). We can see that the paper WHO dental card was recorded quickly, but its reuse due to missing electronic form is difficult. Times for recording data using keyboard or voice in lifetime dental EHR were not significantly different. Conclusion: The clinical practice demanded to find ways to eliminate the need to touch peripherals like keyboard, mouse and touch screen. Therefore the automatic speech recognition was added to enable dentist to use the software without a single touch. This way we eliminated the need for computer operator and unnecessary hygienic procedures (washing hands, changing gloves etc.).","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2013","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0211909","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Originally clinical guidelines are written in everyday language and then they are converted into formal model that can be implemented and processed by computer. If all relevant patient’s treatment data are stored in patient’s Electronic Health Record, the guidelines formal model may be, in principle, compared with patient’s data to determine, if the patient was treated according to the recommended clinical practice. In this article we present an algorithm that enables to compare patient’s data record with EGLIF (Enhanced GLIF) model. EGLIF is a simple enhancement of the standard GLIF model and it was devised to render the comparison more transparent and more convenient. Comparing algorithm is proposed for GLIF models with unambiguous decision steps and for patient’s data records containing all relevant patient’s treatment information. Its modification for arbitrary decision steps can be easily done. However, comparing GLIF or EGLIF model with incomplete patient’s data record is more difficult issue. Some suggestions how to tackle this problem are discussed in the conclusion.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0211904","RVO:67985807","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The definition of Dempster's semigroup (an algebraic structure) of BFs on 3-element frame is recalled from the first part of the study. Results related to Bayesian and quasi Bayesian BFs from the first part are also briefly recalled. Further substructures related to another subsets of general BFs are described and analyzed (including idempotents, simple complementary BFs, generalizations of subsemigroups of simple BFs)  and subalgebras isomorphic to Dempster's semigroup on 2-element frame of discernment.

The reason is that we have to process systems of uncertainties for which the classical conditions like sigma-additivity or linear ordering of values are too restrictive to define sufficiently closely the nature of  uncertainty we would like to specify and process. For the case of non-numerical uncertainty degrees at least the two criteria may be considered. First systems with rather complicated, but sophisticated and nontrivially formally analyzable uncertainty degrees. E.g., uncertainties supported by some algebras or partially ordered structures. Contrary, we may consider more easy non-numerical, but on the intuitive level interpretable relations. Well-known examples of such structures are set-valued possibilistic measures. Some perhaps interesting particular results in this direction will be introduced and analyzed in the contribution.","","","BA","","UT ISI","WUPES 2012.

We will argue that the amorphous systems belong among the  simplest (non-uniform) universal computational devices.

They are by far most frequently tackled using evolutionary algorithms, usually implemented in systems developed specifically for the area of catalysis. Their fitness functions are black-box functions with costly and time-consuming empirical evaluation. This suggests to apply surrogate modeling. The paper points out three difficulties challenging the application of surrogate modeling to catalysts optimization: mixed-variables optimization, assessing the suitability of different models, and scalarization of multiple objectives. It then provides examples of how those challenges are tackled in real-world catalysts optimization tasks. The examples are based on results obtained in three such tasks using one of specific evolutionary optimization systems for catalysis.","","","IN","","","GECCO 2012.

Resistance is partly due to the low tumour uptake of taxanes and their rapid metabolism. Structural modifications of taxanes can reduce their P-glycoprotein-related efflux or decrease metabolism and consequently increase taxane efficiency. This study compared cytotoxicity and effects of the cell cycle, transport and metabolism of novel taxanes SB-T-1102, SB-T-1103, SB-T-1214 and SB-T-1216, fluorinated SB-T-12851, SB-T-12852, SB-T-12853, SB-T-12854 and IDN5109 with paclitaxel in paclitaxel-sensitive (MDA-MB-435) and paclitaxel-resistant (NCI/ADR-RES) human cancer cells. We have shown before that NCI/ADR-RES cells were 1,000-fold less sensitive to paclitaxel than MDA-MB-435 cells in correspondence to P-glycoprotein overexpression and up to 20-fold lower uptake of the drug in the resistant cells. The uptake of novel taxanes was 1.2 to 3.8 times lower than that of paclitaxel in the MDA-MB-435 cells, but 1.5 to 6.5 times higher in NCI/ADR-RES cells. NCI/ADR-RES cells were correspondingly only 2- to 6.6-fold less sensitive than the MDA-MB-435 cells to novel taxanes. Both cell lines showed minimal metabolism of the novel taxanes which was therefore not responsible for their different sensitivity, the observed differences in their individual efficiency and higher effects than paclitaxel. All novel taxanes caused G(2)/M block of the cell cycle similar to paclitaxel, but lower at concentrations by order of magnitude. Thus, structural modifications of taxanes resulting in their decreased P-glycoprotein-related transport probably caused their higher efficiency than paclitaxel in multidrug-resistant NCI/ADR-RES tumour cells.","","","EB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","2","10.1007/s00210-012-0785-4","wos:000308545300010","2-s2.0-84866729228","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0211186","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Linear spectral coherence, mean phase coherence (MPC) z-score and Pearson’s correlation coefficient of analytic amplitudes were evaluated for different spectral bands of whole-night EEG recordings from 25 healthy subjects. Results: Coherence and MPC z-score demonstrated practically the same statistical differences between vigilance stages, confirming the findings of previous coherence-based studies. MPC z-score and amplitude correlations were most correlated (>0.5) between homologous interhemispheric positions and least correlated between nonhomologous interhemispheric positions and between fronto-occipital positions. Conclusions: Coherence and phase synchronization provided essentially the same information. Complete synchronization was manifested by highly coherent phases and correlated amplitudes, as well as by correlated changes of phase synchronization, coherence and amplitude correlations between vigilance states. In cases of weaker coupling, phase synchronization and coherence change in agreement, while behaviour of amplitude correlations differs. Significance: Phase synchronization analysis is not superior to coherence analysis, although the coupling between EEG signals is dominated by phase synchronization which turns into complete synchronization in the most strongly coupled EEG signals.","","","FH","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","5","10.1016/j.clinph.2012.01.016","wos:000307183800023","2-s2.0-84864410479","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0211158","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Among global network properties, small-world property, consisting in existence of relatively short paths together with high clustering of the network, is one of the most discussed and studied. When dealing with coupled dynamical systems, links among units of the system are commonly quantified by a measure of pairwise statistical dependence of observed time series (functional connectivity). We argue that the functional connectivity approach leads to upwardly biased estimates of small-world characteristics (with respect to commonly used random graph models) due to partial transitivity of the accepted functional connectivity measures such as the correlation coefficient. In particular, this may lead to observation of small-world characteristics in connectivity graphs estimated from generic randomly connected dynamical systems. The ubiquity and robustness of the phenomenon are documented by an extensive parameter study of its manifestation in a multivariate linear autoregressive process, with discussion of the potential relevance for nonlinear processes and measures.","","","BB","","hodui2015 *** excelent2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","10","10.1063/1.4732541","wos:000309427500007","2-s2.0-84866936374","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0211061","RVO:67985807","0;1","","","","","","","","","",""

This has lead to  the identification of disease-related alterations affecting functional connectivity. The mechanism of how such alterations in functional connectivity arise in a structured network of interacting neural populations is as yet poorly understood. Here we use a modeling approach to explore the way in which this can arise and to highlight the important role that local population dynamics can have in shaping emergent spatial functional connectivity patterns. The local dynamics for a neural population is taken to be of the Wilson–Cowan type, whilst the structural connectivity patterns used, describing long-range anatomical connections, cover both realistic scenarios (from the CoComac database) and idealized ones that allow for more detailed  theoretical study. We have calculated graph–theoretic measures of functional network topology from numerical simulations of  model networks. The effect of the form of local dynamics on the observed network state is quantified by examining the correlation between structural and functional connectivity. We document a profound and systematic dependence of the simulated functional connectivity patterns on the parameters controlling the dynamics. Importantly, we show that a weakly coupled oscillator theory explaining these correlations and their variation across parameter space can be developed. This theoretical development provides a novel way to characterize the mechanisms for the breakdown of functional connectivity in diseases through changes in local dynamics.","","","FH","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","2","10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.08081.x","wos:000306475300003","2-s2.0-84864011851","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0211060","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Efforts to overcome this limitation led to the development of alternative rating strategies, based on probabilistic and dynamic methods. One such strategy is the seasonal static thermal rating. It uses a probabilistic rating approach with explicit treatment of seasonal effects on conductor temperature. In this paper, we present several variants of seasonal ratings, and analyze their performance with respect to other rating approaches. Seasonal ratings use a set of predetermined probabilistic ratings that are engaged according to the season of year or time of day. By alternating among several ratings, transmission lines can be operated closer to their actual ampacity. In addition, seasonal ratings can reduce the risk of thermal overload, compared to the uniform probabilistic rating which remains constant at all times. Despite the risk reduction, and counter to the common belief, they still pose a significant risk of conductor thermal overload. Characteristics of several seasonal rating strategies are illustrated using a case study involving a power transmission line in Newfoundland, Canada. Simulation results show that seasonal ratings can provide a modest increase in transmission line throughput, compared to the basic probabilistic rating. However, they also confirm the high levels of residual risk.","","","JE","","grant GA AV ??? *** podle KVK  e-ISBN  978-1-4577-1001-8 (a to je uvedeno ve WOS) a 978-1-4577-1002-5 **** atestace2013ano","PES 2011.

A fuzzy subset A of a (crisp) set X is characterized by assigning to each element x of X the degree of membership of x in A In particular, if X is a set of propositions then its elements may be assigned their degree of truth, which may be “absolutely true”, “absolutely false” or some intermediate truth degree: a proposition may be more true than another proposition. This is obvious in the case of vague (imprecise) propositions like “this person is old” (beautiful, rich, etc.). And this leads to fuzzy logic. In the analogy to various definitions of operations on fuzzy sets (intersection, union, complement,…) one may ask how propositions can be combined by connectives (conjunction, disjunction, negation,…) and if the truth degree of a composed proposition is determined by the truth degrees of its components, i.e. if the connectives have their corresponding truth functions (like truth tables of classical logic). Saying “yes” (which is the mainstream of fuzzy logic) makes fuzzy logic to something principally different from probability theory since e.g. the probability of conjunction of two propositions is not determined by the probabilities of those propositions.","","","BA","","Set ISBN 978-94-007-0920-1","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2013","","10.1007/978-94-007-0080-2_5","wos:000317426000007","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0210669","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

It is based on the 1999 data of 383 students admitted that year, 163 of them failed and 220 succeeded in finishing the study. By use of Pearson’s correlations between predictors, cluster analysis and logistic regression we show that preadmission grades predict the overall success in medical study with the same accuracy as admission tests but they describe different dimensions of students’ abilities. Simultaneous use of GPA and AT in the admission process of all students should bring higher quality to the selection and also practical advantages for future analyses. Nevertheless, the idea of having a group of the students admitted based only on an excellent GPA could be considered quite reasonable.","","","BB","DOI nezjištěno","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","","","wos:000311710600013","2-s2.0-84864824978","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0007371","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Boolean factor analysis can serve as a powerful tool to solve the task, when dealing with binary data. Here we provide a short insight into a new approach to Boolean factor analysis we have developed as an extension of our previously proposed method: Hopfield-like Attractor Neural Network with Increasing Activity. We have greatly enhanced its functionality, having complemented this method by maximizing the data set likelihood function. We have defined this Likelihood function on the basis of the data generative model proposed previously. As a result, in such a way we can obtain a full set of generative model parameters. We demonstrate the efficiency of the new method using the artificial signals, which are random mixtures of horizontal and vertical bars that are a benchmark for Boolean factor analysis. Then we show that the method can be used for real task solving when analyzing data from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.","","","IN","","UT ISI","ISNN 2012.

From a computational viewpoint, amorphous computing systems differ from the classical ones almost in every aspect. They consist of a set of tiny, independent, anonymous and self-powered processors or robots that can communicate wirelessly to a limited distance. The processors are simplified down to the absolute necessaries in order to enable their massive production. The amorphous systems appear in many variants. Their processors can be randomly placed in a closed area or volume and form an ad-hoc network; in some applications they can move, either actively, or passively (e.g., in a bloodstream). Depending on their environment, they can communicate either via radio or via signal molecules. Assuming exponential progress in all sciences resulting in our ability to produce amorphous computing systems with myriads of processors, an unmatched application potential is expected profoundly to change all areas of science and life.","","","IN","","hodui2015 *** do RIV zadáno s chybným rokem 2012, opraven rok vydani dodatečne na 2013, podle KVK rok 2012 i 2013, oprava v RIVu - zkontrolováno, byla provedena","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2015","1","10.1142/9789814374309_0013","wos:000337346900015","2-s2.0-84967693057","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0209964","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We have investigated the association between ozone (O(3)) levels and hospital admissions and mortality due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases for Prague inhabitants for summer months (April-September) over the 5-year period 2002-2006. Our hypothesis was that ambient O(3) levels in Prague resulted in adverse health outcomes and were associated with increased mortality and hospital admissions. METHODS: The effect of O(3) on mortality and hospital admissions was investigated using the negative binomial regression after controlling for the influence of meteorological factors (air temperature and relative humidity) and calendar effects (seasonal patterns, long-term trends and day of week). RESULTS: We found a statistically significant association between O(3) levels and daily mortality from respiratory diseases. Relative risk of 1.080 (95% CI: 1.031-1.132) was observed for mortality from respiratory diseases per 10 μg m(-3) increase in 1-day lagged daily mean O(3) concentration. No statistically significant association was detected between O(3) concentrations and daily mortality from all causes, daily mortality from cardiovascular diseases and hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The O(3) effects differed in men and women, nevertheless, the results were ambiguous with respect to used lag and O(3) metrics. No significant confounding effects of PM(10) on the investigated association were observed. CONCLUSIONS: O(3) exposure in Prague, though lower as compared to many other cities in Europe, is high enough to cause adverse health effects.","","","DN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2013","","10.1007/s00420-012-0751-y","wos:000313012900011","2-s2.0-84872333173","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0209359","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: One hundred patients undergoing endoscopy and 100 physicians were given a questionnaire describing in detail the techniques of NOTES and laparoscopic appendectomy. They were asked about the reasons for their preference, choice of orifice, and extent of complication risk they were willing to accept.  RESULTS: Fifty patients (50%) and only 21 physicians (21%) preferred NOTES (P < 0.001). Patients had previously heard of NOTES less frequently (7% vs 73%, P < 0.001) and had undergone endoscopy more frequently (88% vs 36%, P < 0.001) than physicians. Absence of hernia was the most common reason for NOTES preference in physicians (80% vs 44%, P = 0.003), whereas reduced pain was the most common reason in patients (66% vs 52%). Physicians were more likely to refuse NOTES as a novel and unsure technique (P < 0.001) and having an increased risk of infection (P < 0.001). The preferred access site in both groups was colon followed by stomach, with vagina being rarely preferred. In multivariable modeling, those with high-school education [odds ratio (OR): 2.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23-5.83] and prior colonoscopy (OR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.05-4.19) were more likely to prefer NOTES over laparoscopic appendectomy. There was a steep decline in NOTES preference with increased rate of procedural complications. Male patients were more likely to consent to their wives vaginal NOTES appendectomy than male physicians (P = 0.02).  CONCLUSION: The preference of NOTES for appendectomy was greater in patients than physicians and was related to reduced pain and absence of hernia rather than lack of scarring.","","Cíl: Posoudit vnímání transluminální endoskopické chirurgie (NOTES) jako potenciální alternativní techniky operace slepého střeva. Metody: Sto pacientů podstupujících endoskopii a sto lékařů obdrželo dotazník s podrobným popisem techniky laparoskopické apendektomie NOTES. Byli požádáni uvést důvody svých preferencí, volbu upřednostňovaného otvoru a rozsah komplikací a rizika, které byli ochotni přijmout. Výsledky: Padesát pacientů (50%) a pouze jednadvacet lékařů (21%) upřednostňovalo techniku NOTES (p <0,001). Pacienti měli srovnatelně menší povědomí o existenci NOTES (7% vs 73%, P <0,001) a častěji též v minulosti podstoupili endoskopický zákrok (88% vs 36%, P <0,001) než lékaři. Absence kýly byla nejčastějším důvodem pro preferenci NOTES u lékařů (80% vs 44%, p = 0,003), zatímco snížená hladina bolesti byla nejčastějším důvodem u pacientů (66% vs 52%). Lékaři častěji odmítli NOTES jako novou a neprověřenou techniku (P <0,001) a též z důvodu zvýšeného rizika infekce (P <0,001). Preferovaným přístupovým bodem pro výkon operace bylo v obou skupinách tlusté střevo, následované žaludkem, pochva byla upřednostňována pouze zřídka. Mnohonásobná logistická regrese naznačila, že osoby se středoškolským vzděláním [poměr šancí (OR): 2,68, 95% interval spolehlivosti (CI): 1,23-5,83] a historií kolonoskopie (OR: 2,10, 95% CI: 05.1.-19.4.) dávaly s větší pravděpodobností přednost NOTES přes laparoskopickou apendektomií. Zvýšená míra komplikací měla za následek prudký pokles preferencí pro NOTES. Muži pacienti dávali častěji souhlas s vaginální NOTES apendektomií svých manželek než muži lékaři (p = 0,02). Závěr: Preference pro realizaci operace slepého střeva prostřednictvím transluminální endoskopické chirurgie (NOTES) byla vyšší než u pacientů než u lékařů a souvisela se snížením hladiny bolesti a absencí kýly spíše než následným pooperačním výskytem jizev.","FJ","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","10","10.3748/wjg.v18.i15.1800","wos:000303278400012","2-s2.0-84866173479","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0209349","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

To identify individual source contribution into electroencephalogram recorded during the training Independent Component Analysis was used. Then those independent components for which the BCI system classification accuracy was at maximum were treated as relevant to performing the motor imagery tasks, since they demonstrated well exposed event related de-synchronization and event related synchronization of the sensorimotor mi-rhythm during imagining of contra- and ipsilateral hand movements. To reveal neurophysiological nature of these components we have solved the inverse EEG problem to locate the sources of brain activity causing these components to appear in EEG. The sources were located in hand representation areas of the primary sensorimotor cortex.

The accuracy of their classifying specifies the efficiency of brain-computer interface (BCI), allowing to control external technical devices directly by signals of brain activity instead of natural muscle forces. The sources of brain activity corresponding to motor imagination are revealed by Independent Component Analysis (ICA). EEG during motor imagination is shown to be a superposition of components dependent and not dependent of the type of imaginary movement. Components dependent on the type of imaginary movement are relevant for EEG pattern classifying. They are localized in central brain areas. Components not dependent of the type of imaginary movement are localized in occipital areas. They relate to the attention to task performance independently of the imaginary movement and not relevant for BCI efficiency. Excluding of these components from EEG patterns improves essentially the BCI performance.","","IN","","zmena BB na IN *** Источники активности мозга, значимые и незначимые для классификации паттернов ЭЭГ, соответствующих воображению движений *** Показано, что при воображении движений активность мозга является суперпозицией компонент как зависящих, так и не зависящих от типа воображаемого движения.

However, analytical models need some unrealistic conditions to be supposed. This study describes the development of a method based on finite difference approximation of the process governed by the Fickian diffusion equation and on the minimization of an objective function representing the disparity between the experimental and simulated time-varying concentration profiles. Our method improves on other models by accounting for experimentally measured time-varying Dirichlet boundary conditions, and can include a reaction term as well. As a result we obtain both the overall (time averaged) diffusion coefficient D and the sequence of diffusivities Dj based on two successive fluorescence profiles in j-th time interval. Due to the noisy data, we cope with an inverse ill-posed problem and a regularization technique is mandatory.","","","BA","Vytvořena duplicita mimo asep 0425117 kvůli přidání grantu ED2.1.00/03.0110 MBU do RIV v roce 2014","hodui2015 *** správně podle CEP je GA MŠk(CZ) ED2.1.00/03.0110, doplněn obor MBU, kvuli hcybne zapsanemu grantu vytvoren 0425117, vyhledove smazat","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2013","2013","","10.1016/j.mcm.2011.12.029","wos:000315863300045","2-s2.0-84875388687","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0208678","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

These criticalpoints could be either bifurcation or limit points. When the external load is parametrized by a single parameter, the non-linear stability eigenvalue problem consists of solving the equilibrium equations along the criticality condition. Several techniques exist for solution of such a system. Their algorithmic treatment is usually focused for direct linear solvers and thus use the block elimination strategy. In this paper special emphasis is given for a strategy which can be used also with iterative linear solvers. Comparison to the block elimination strategy with direct linear solvers is given. Due to the non-uniqueness of the critical eigenmode a normalizing condition is required. In addition, for bifurcation points, the Jacobian matrix of the augmented system is singular at the criticalpoint and additional stabilization is required in order to maintain the quadratic convergence of the Newton’s method. Depending on the normalizing condition, convergence to acriticalpoint with negative load parameter value can happen. The form of the normalizing equation is critically discussed. Due to the slenderness of the buckling sensitive structures the resulting matrices are ill-conditioned and a good preconditioner is mandatory for efficient solution.","","","BA","","grant vypadl, nutné prohlášení autora","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","3","10.1016/j.compstruc.2012.02.009","wos:000309304100011","2-s2.0-84865782578","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0208657","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Fyzioterapie využívající neurofyziologických poznatků má však mnohem větší potenciál, který se však musi ověřit. Potenciální mechanizmy účinku fyzioterapie na imunitní systém vyplývají z propojeni mozečku s limbickým systémem (via motor cortex, hypotalamus a via hypotalamus - paleocerebellum a neocerebellum) (4). Fyzioterapie využívá různých senzomotorických technik v různých posturálních pozicích, čímž stimuluje mozeček a tím ovlivňuje i další systémy, mezi nimi i imunitní.

In this study, the impact of facilitation physiotherapy (FP) on the humoral and cellular immunity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) was monitored. Methods: Plasma immunoglobulins and membrane markers were measured in 20 stable MS patients twice during two months. During this time, 12 patients underwent 2 months FP and 8 did not change their habits. Plasma immunoglobulins were measured by laser nephelometry and membrane markers were stained by monoclonal antibody conjugated with fluorochromes and analyzed by flow cytometry. Wilcoxon signed-rank (paired) test and Wilcoxon rank-sum (two-sample) test was used for analyses. Results: We found significant changes in patients after FP in number of immunological parameters (IgG, IgG1, IgA, CD3+CD8+, CD3+, NK cells, lymphocytes, neutrophiles. while in patients who did not change their habits, there was a significant increase only in IgA. However, the amount of changes after two months follow-up was significantly different in the two groups only in IgA (p = 0.008). Conclusion: FP in MS influences the immunologic profile of patients with MS.","","FH","","UT ISI","Kinantropologické dny MUDr. V. Soulka.

The aim of our study was to assess whether implant therapy improves OHRQoL in dental patients. Patients receiving at least one implant completed a health-related questionnaire before and after the implantation (minimum 1.5 months). Questions covered the functional and aesthetic scales (AS). Paired differences in individual scores were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A univariate analysis of covariance was used to relate overall and scale-specific average paired differences to age, gender, marital and educational status. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to assess interactions between the covariates and different scales of outcome. All tests were performed at statistical significance level α = 0.05. All twelve Wilcoxon tests supported an improvement in OHRQoL after implant placement. On the AS, the mean difference in OHRQoL scores was found to be associated with marital status, presence of aesthetic reasons for undergoing the surgery and number of front teeth replaced by implants. On the functional scale (FS), most significant associations were observed with the number of front teeth replaced via implantation, followed by the presence of chewing problems and marital status. The multivariate analysis helped to identify the covariates that varied significantly over the two scales of interest. Effects of covariates responding significantly differently on different scales should not be summarized using an overall univariate analysis, using paired score differences averaged over all items. Such effect summary would be misleading. In the present study, significant implant-related improvements in OHRQoL were observed on both the aesthetic and FS in patients with at least one implant in the front dental area.","","Kvalita života ve vztahu k orálnímu zdraví (OHRQoL) zahrnuje širokou škálu různých aspektů a ovlivňujících faktorů. Cílem naší studie bylo zjistit, zda může použití implantátů souviset se zlepšením kvality života pacientů. Pacienti, kteří obdrželi alespoň jeden zubní implantát, vyplnili zdravotní dotazník před implantací a poté (nejdříve však po 1,5 měsících). Otázky mapovaly fukční a estetickou škálu kvality života. Párové rozdíly v jednotlivých skórech byly analyzovány pomocí Wilcoxonova testu. Jednorozměrná analýza kovariance byla využita k hodnocení souvislostí párových rozdílů mezi ukazateli kvality života celkově resp. na jednotlivých škálách s věkem, pohlavím, manželským stavem a úrovní dosaženého vzdělání. Mnohorozměrná analýza kovariance byla využita k hodnocení interakcí mezi nezávislými proměnnými a dílčími škálami mnohorozměrné informace o kvalitě života. Všechny testy byly provedeny na hladině statistické významnosti α = 0.05. Výsledky všech 12 Wilcoxonových testů souhlasně naznačily zlepšení OHRQoL skórů po zavedení implantátů. Na estetické škále souvisely rozdíly ve skórech s manželským stavem, estetickými důvody pro zavedení implantátů a počtem implantátů použitých ve frontální části chrupu. Na funkční škále jsme pozorovali nejvýznamnější asociaci s počtem zavedených implantátů ve frontální části chrupu, dále s potížemi pacienta při žvýkání potravy a též s manželským stavem. Mnohorozměrná analýza napomohla identifikaci proměnných, jejichž efekt se významně lišil na obou sledovaných škálách. Efekty proměnných, které se na jednotlivých škálách významně  odlišují, by neměly být hodnoceny prostřednictvím globální jednorozměrné analýzy kovariance, která využívá průměrných rozdílů v párových skórech přes všechny položky. Takto dosažené závěry by mohly být zavádějící. V této studii jsme pozorovali významné zlepšení skórů OHRQoL jak na estetické tak na funkční škále u pacientů, kterým zaveden alespoň jeden implantát ve frontální oblasti chrupu.","FF","","hodui2015 valenta","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2012","1","10.1111/j.1600-0528.2011.00668.x","wos:000300768600010","2-s2.0-84857707973","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0208055","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that in accordance with the so-called extended Turing machine paradigm such systems can be modelled as non-uniform evolving interactive systems whose computational power surpasses that of the classical Turing machines. Our results show that there is an infinite hierarchy of cognitive systems. Within this hierarchy, there are systems achieving and surpassing the human intelligence level. Any intelligence level surpassing the human intelligence is called the superintelligence level. We will argue that, formally, from a computation viewpoint the human-level intelligence is upper-bounded by the  class of the Arithmetical Hierarchy. In this class, there are problems whose complexity grows faster than any computable function and, therefore, not even exponential growth of computational power can help in solving such problems, or reach the level of superintelligence.","","","IN","","hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","1","10.1007/s12559-012-9124-9","wos:000308817500005","2-s2.0-84866488091","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0207809","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Modalities and predicates have since ancient time been central notions in logic. In the 20th century, various systems of non-classical logics have emerged, with applications in many disciplines like Computer Science, Linguistics, Mathematics, and Philosophy.  This gave rise to the questions of non-classical treatment of quantification and modalities and their accommodation in these non-classical settings.  In response, various modal and predicate variants of non-classical logics have been introduced and studied in the past decades. Although there are many good conferences on (mainly propositional) non-classical logics, this conference was solely dedicated to modal and predicate non-classical logics. Its aim was to bring together esearchers from various branches of non-classical logics, not only to present recent advances in their particular fields, but also to identify common problems and methods and foster the exchange of ideas between researchers from separate fields.","","","BA","","","NCMPL 2011.

It is a worldwide extensive disorder regardless of age, gender or ethnic group. At present the disease includes nine clinically different types. Typical clinical features are brittle bones, high frequency of fractures and bone deformities. The other observed signs are blue sclera, dentinogenesis imperfect and otosclerosis. The first four types of the disease arise from mutations in collagen type I genes, composed from COL1A1 and COL1A2 chains. A result of these mutations is the production of shortened or structurally defective protein. Individuals affected by OI forms V to IX have mutations in proteins encoded by following genes: CRTAP, LEPRE1, PPIB, FKBP10. Collagenous types of the illness exhibit a broad range of severity depending on type and mutation localization in the structure of the collagen type I. Objectives and Methods: The aim of this study is the description of the clinical forms of the disease, identifying mutations and polymorphisms of genes of the collagen type I by a molecular genetic analysis of genomic DNA of Czech OI patients. Results: Currently in the Czech population there are described mutations and polymorphisms only of MLBR2 region, namely exons 31, 33 and 36 and introns 32 and 39, of the COL1A1 gene of 25 OI patients. Mgr. Lucie Šormová Conclusion: It is important to perform a further molecular genetic analysis of both collagen type I genes for the detection of the widest possible mutational spectrum for determination of possible genotype phenotype relationship of affected individuals.","","","IN","","atestace2013ne","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2012","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0206577","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Results: Three thousand five hundred and seventy eight NT measurements obtained by seven sonographers were eligible for designed analysis. In the assessment of the sonographer-specific NT distributions three of them did not meet due to the underestimation the FMF and one the WIHRI criteria. Using SPC methods, three sonographers presented unsatisfactory performance with underestimation, three sonographers overall satisfactory performance with transient periods of over- and underestimation and one sonographer showed perfect performance.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2012","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0206571","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Objectives: At the beginning there has been constructed an electronic dental cross ""DentCross"", which was representing patients dental data in the graphical form. It has been completed with the system of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) and voice synthesis module (TTS). Methods: The main goal of this work was to reach the high entirety of the system and its automatization. For this reason it has been completed with the special record medium for the temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Results: Concerning the experience with the old version the knowledge database (KB) for TMD has been structured differently. A classification diagnostic schema by the American Academy of Orofacial Pain (AAOP) has been used. The KB has been created in the MUDR KB Editor application. On this basis a relational database has been constructed and a user interface for data collection based on MUDR and MUDRLite EHR systems was developed. Conclusions: The main advantage of this system is determination of probable diagnosis of the disease (AAOP) by the system (""custom"" component).

Smith's fuzzy plurivaluationistic semantics of vagueness with a logical justification. Fuzzy plurivaluations are explained as the classes of models of theories in fuzzy logic expressing the meaning postulates of vague terms. Consequently, supertruth corresponds to deducibility in fuzzy logic and penumbral connections to the axioms of the theory. In the logic-based fuzzy plurivaluationistic picture, vagueness is reduced to semantic indeterminacy, with graduality as only an optional ingredient, in contrast to Smith's definition of vagueness.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2012","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0206317","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

At least two features set the current volume apart from other texts: first, the interdisciplinary nature of the topic is nicely reflected by the wide range of interests of the authors, who include philosophers, linguists, logicians, as well as mathematicians and compute scientists. Secondly, all the papers are accompanied by comments written by other authors and a few outside experts. These comments and corresponding replies by the authors document the very lively ongoing debate on adequate models of vague language.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2012","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0206212","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chapter 2","","mathematical fuzzy logic - weakly implicative logics - abstract algebraic logic - non-classical logics - semilinear logics","The aim of this chapter is to present a marriage of Mathematical Fuzzy Logic and (Abstract) Algebraic Logic in order to provide a general background for the rest of the handbook. We use the notions and techniques from the latter to create a new framework where we can develop in a natural way a particular technical notion corresponding to the intuition of fuzzy logics as the logics of chains. Our framework is the class of weakly implicative semilinear logics, roughly speaking logics with implication connective which are complete with respect to the class of linear ordered matrices. We choose the term `semilinear' instead of `fuzzy', because the term `fuzzy' is too heavily charged with many conflicting potential meanings. The chapter is structured as follows. In Section 1 we introduce the necessary notions from (Abstract) Algebraic Logic, the definition of weakly implicative logic and some refinements thereof and provide three increasingly stronger completeness theorems for them. Moreover, we present a very general notion of substructural logics as a particular family of weakly implicative logics, discuss their syntactical properties and deduction theorems, and we conclude with a rather general study of disjunction connectives. Section 2 presents and studies the main notion of this chapter: semilinearity. It characterizes semilinear logics in terms of properties of filters and properties of disjunctions, and gives methods to axiomatize semilinear logics. Section 3 studies first-order predicate systems built over weakly implicative semilinear logics. It gives axiomatizations, completeness theorems, and a general process of Skolemization. We conclude with Section 4 providing historical remarks to understand the genesis of the ideas and results presented in this chapter and many bibliographical references for further studies in related topics.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2012","12","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0206164","","1","","","","","","","","","",""

Each patient completed oral health questionnaires, which were then statistically evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks  test and Analysis of Covariance from a functional and aesthetic point of view. Differential response on individual scales was assessed  using multivariate approach. All twelve marginal Wilcoxon tests showed an overall improvement in OHQoL (α = 0.05). On the aesthetic  scale, OHRQoL was found to be associated with marital status, aesthetic reasons for undergoing surgery and number of front teeth  replaced by implants. On the functional scale, three covariates were statistically significantly and appeared to have affected the levels of  OHRQoL. The most significant explanatory effect was observed for the number of front teeth replaced via implantation, followed by the  presence of chewing problems. Marital status was also found to have significantly affected the OHRQoL functional scale. Significant  implant-related improvements in both scales were observed in patients with at least one implant in the front dental area.","","","FF","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2012","","10.2478/s11536-011-0125-y","wos:000300055200013","2-s2.0-84860768617","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0206154","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore the robust methods need to be equipped by their own diagnostic tools. This paper describes diagnostics for robust estimation of parameters in two econometric models derived from the linear regression. Both methods are special cases of the generalized method of moments estimator based on implicit weighting of individual observations. This has the effect of down-weighting less reliable observations and ensures a high robustness and low sub-sample sensitivity of the methods. Firstly, for a robust regression method efficient under heteroscedasticity we derive the Durbin–Watson test of independence of random regression errors, which is based on the approximation to the exact null distribution of the test statistic. Secondly we study the asymptotic behavior of the Durbin–Watson test statistic for the weighted instrumental variables estimator, which is a robust analogy of the classical instrumental variables estimator.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2012","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0205462","","1","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this problem, we propose a fully declarative language for encoding preferences conditional on the current state of the world represented as a relation database instance. Being based purely on the qualitative type of information about the preference model, the language supports encoding intuitive statements about preferences and having constructs for various kinds of preferences, the language leads to a flexible approach for specifying the most desirable choices of autonomous systems that act on behalf of their designers.

In addition, we discuss sensitivity analysis and evaluation of the models, user operational requirements, such as model availability and documentation, and output availability and dissemination. In this manner, this article allows for the evaluation of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various modelling systems and modelling approaches. Finally, this article highlights the most prominent gaps of knowledge for chemical weather forecasting models and suggests potential priorities for future research directions, for the following selected focus areas: emission inventories, the integration of numerical weather prediction and atmospheric chemical transport models, boundary conditions and nesting of models, data assimilation of the various chemical species, improved understanding and parameterization of physical processes, better evaluation of models against data and the construction of model ensembles.","","","DG","","hodui2015 *** vyšlo nejdříve v Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussions, doi: 10.5194/acpd-11-5985-2011","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2012","21","10.5194/acp-12-1-2012","wos:000300320200001","2-s2.0-84855484388","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0204934","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We deal with isothermal steady flow and analyse the Galerkin discretization of the corresponding equations. We discuss the existence and uniqueness of discrete solutions and their convergence to the solution of the original problem. In particular, we derive a priori error estimates, which provide optimal rates of convergence with respect to the expected regularity of the solution. Finally, we demonstrate the achieved results by numerical experiments. The fluid models under consideration appear in many practical problems, for instance, in elastohydrodynamic lubrication where very high pressures occur. Here we consider shear-thinning fluid models similar to the power-law/Carreau model. A re- stricted sublinear dependence of the viscosity on the pressure is allowed. The mathematical theory concerned with the self-consistency of the governing equations has emerged only recently. We adopt the established theory in the context of discrete approximations. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the finite element method for fluids with pressure-dependent viscosity. The derived estimates coincide with the optimal error estimates established recently for Carreau-type models, which are covered as a special case.","","","BK","","hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","1","10.1093/imanum/drr033","wos:000309923300012","2-s2.0-84867523146","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0204791","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

It can be found that, by using a standard regression model for suitably transformed losses, such estimation is possible, including estimation of probable bounds. The suggested procedure is based on the Basel II Directive (CRD) in the operational risk regulation and control. This procedure is not primarily oriented on risk capital estimate (specifically emphasized in the regulation rules of Basel II), but rather on prediction of risk losses behavior in the next period of time.

Where existing approaches rely on absolute bounds on the execution time, we aim to express assertions on code performance in relative, hardware-independent terms. To this end, we introduce Stochastic Performance Logic (SPL), which allows making statements about relative method performance. Since SPL interpretation is based on statistical tests applied to performance measurements, it allows (for a special class of formulas) calculating the minimum probability at which a particular SPL formula holds. We prove basic properties of the logic and present an algorithm for SAT-solver-guided evaluation of SPL formulas, which allows optimizing the number of performance measurements that need to be made. Finally, we propose integration of SPL formulas with Java code using higher-level performance annotations, for performance testing and documentation purposes.","","","IN","","dle MFF pouze LB domácí autor UI *** UT ISI *** chybí autor Tůma, P.

A pilot study","","multiple sclerosis - physiotherapy - facilitation - humoral and cellular immunity - immunomodulation - dehydroepiandrosterone","The aim of this study was to confirm the immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory changes in the immunologic profile after two months of the facilitation physiotherapy in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS); and to determine whether the changes in the immunologic profile correlate with the changes in dehydroepiandrosterone, the brain microstructure and clinical functions.  A group of 12 MS patients was examined twice: at the beginning and 2 months later after the patients had undergone the facilitation therapy. Standardized tests evaluating chosen clinical functions (balance, righting, equilibrium and protective reactions, tremor, dysdiadochokinesis, dysmetry, fine hand function and walking), immune parameters (parameters of the humoral and cellular immunity), dehydroepiandrosterone and diffusion tensor imaging (the fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity) were measured. The patients underwent the facilitation physiotherapy in two sessions lasting two hours each week for two months. All clinical and diffusion tensor imaging parameters significantly improved following the therapy. Without the correction for multiple comparisons, there were significant changes in the IgG, IgG1 subclasses, in the numbers of Neutrophils and Lymphocytes, the T cells (CD3+) absolute number, the T cytotoxic subpopulation (CD3+CD8+) absolute number, B cells (CD19+) and the Natural killer cells. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the changes in the clinical functions and the changes in IgG1, and between the changes in the mean diffusivity and the changes in CD3+CD8+ absolute. The changes in the immune parameters and the mentioned correlations were not significant in view of the number of comparisons and thus necessitate further validation. No changes in the dehydroepiandrosterone concentration after the therapy were confirmed. The study suggests new possibilities of physiotherapy to influence the psycho–neuro–endocrine– immune response in MS patients.","","","EC","DOI nezjištěno","nefunguje ??? http://node.nel.edu/?node_id=12717","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","","","wos:000208852500013","2-s2.0-84982298860","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0203660","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

There are many approaches in the literature that try to solve this hitherto rather ill-defined task. In the present, we propose a general generative model of binary data for Boolean Factor Analysis and introduce two new Expectation-Maximization Boolean Factor Analysis algorithms which maximize the likelihood of a Boolean Factor Analysis solution. To show the maturity of our solutions we propose an informational measure of Boolean Factor Analysis efficiency. Using the so-called bars problem benchmark, we compare the efficiencies of the proposed algorithms to that of Dendritic Inhibition Neural Network, Maximal Causes Analysis, and Boolean Matrix Factorization. Last mentioned methods were taken as related methods as they are supposed to be the most efficient in bars problem benchmark. Then we discuss the peculiarities of the two methods we proposed and the three related methods in performing Boolean Factor Analysis.","","Výzkum metod pro analýzu skrytých struktur binárních dat vysoké dimenze je jednou z nejvýznamnějších výzev současnosti v oblasti strojového učení.

Such practices require techniques permitting rapid prototyping of systems, corresponding tests and simulations. One of the well-adopted rapid prototyping techniques is polyglot programming combining multiple, mainly scripting, languages during development of systems. This permits the use of a specialized language for dedicated system concerns and also allows for a continuous change and re-deployment of implementation. Despite the advantages, rapid prototyping with help of polyglot programming is still not well supported in the domain of component-based systems, which makes it difficult to quickly prototype and test these systems. To address the obstacle, the paper describes a general technique for transparent and extensible combining of multiple languages for purpose of rapid prototyping during development of component-based systems with help of advanced component frameworks.","","","JC","","UT ISI  printISBN 978-1-4577-1027-8, titulni list ISBN 978-0-7695-4488-5 dle MFF TB není domácí autor UI *** atestace2013ano","SEAA 2011.

In those areas, however, the evaluation of the black-box fitness is often costly and time-consuming. Such a situation is usually  tackled by evaluating the original fitness only sometimes, and evaluating its appropriate response-surface model otherwise, called surrogate model of the fitness. Several kinds of models have been successful in surrogate modelling, and  a variety of models of each kind can be obtained through parametrization. Therefore, real-world applications of surrogate modelling entail the problem of assessing the suitability of different models for the optimization task being  solved. The present paper attempts to systematically inves-  tigate this problem. It surveys available methods to assess  model suitability and reports the incorporation of several such methods in our recently proposed approach to surrogate modelling based on radial basis function networks. In  addition to the commonly used global suitability of a model,  it pays much attention also to its local suitability for a given  input. Finally, it shows some results of testing several of  the surveyed methods in two real-world applications.","","","IN","","UT ISI  *** vyšlo v CEUR Workshop Proceedings, vol 788, ISSN 1613-0073","ITAT 2011.

The beta-binomial formula derived from Dirichlet distribution was used for calculation of more complex situations. Results: From many various complications in the model of the island problem there was shown how to work with uncertainty in a population size. The beta-binomial formula was used to include a subpopulation structure and in issues of DNA mixtures. Conclusions: In particular, the influence of a population structure is now explored insufficiently. Using the results of H. Kubátová in this area, a new formula was derived.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2012","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0202834","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The main motivations for the comparison are nearly identical ways of development, and the same format of both specifications. Methods: HL7 DAM is much broader than EuroMISE MDMC. Thus I focus only on data elements present in MDMC but absent in HL7 DAM. Also different scales of elements present in both models are compared. Results: I have found 25 elements out of 181 elements defined in MDMC which are not contained in HL7 DAM.

The respective computational models  have been recently introduced and studied in a series of  works by J. Wiedermann and his Ph.D. student L. Petru°.  From a computational viewpoint, amorphous computing  systems differ from the classical ones almost in every  aspect: they consist of a set of tiny, independent and selfpowered  processors or robots that can communicate wirelessly  to a limited distance. The processors are randomly  placed in a closed area or volume and form an ad-hoc  network; in some applications they can move, either  actively, or passively (e.g., in a bloodstream). Assuming  the exponential progress in all sciences resulting in our  ability to produce amorphous computing systems with  myriads of processors, an unmatched application potential  is expected profoundly to change all areas of science and  life. But prior to this state of the matters theoretical and  practical studies of the computational properties and efficiency  of amorphous computing systems must be performed.  It is expected that an indispensable part of  computer science will be affected by this trend.","","","IN","","UTISI","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2012","1","10.1007/s11047-011-9281-x","wos:000300891600007","2-s2.0-84857894893","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0202638","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Such constructions  have been known only in the case of width 2 and in very restricted cases  of bounded width. In this paper, we characterize the hitting sets for read-once  branching programs of width 3 by a so-called richness condition. In particular,  we show that such sets hit the class of read-once conjunctions of DNF and CNF  (i.e. the weak richness). Moreover, we prove that any rich set extended with all  strings within Hamming distance of 3 is a hitting set for read-once branching  programs of width 3. Then, we show that any almost O(log n)-wise independent  set satisfies the richness condition. By using such a set due to Alon et al.

Instead of generating individuals through genetic operations (crossover, mutation), they estimate distribution of solutions with higher fitness evaluation: a model of such distribution is constructed and this model is sampled to obtain a new population. In todays EDA, graphical probabilistic and Gaussian models are used most commonly, which are however either computationally infeasible or unrealistic in many real-world problems. Therefore, other kinds of models are appearing. In this paper copulas are used to construct a model of the distribution of feasible solutions. The copula-based EDA (CEDA) is presented with several kinds of copulas, and brief comparison with standard evolutionary algorithms is provided.","","","IN","","","ITAT 2011.

Both models have their advantages: RBF networks are  known to be universal approximators and they allow higher  flexibility in choice of free parameters which leads  to smaller model complexity. On the other hand, kernel  models benefit from geometrical properties of Hilbert spaces generated by symmetric positive semidefinite kernels. These properties allow applications of maximal margin classification, regularization modeling generalization in learning  from data and description of optimal solutions of learning tasks. We investigate these two types of models in the  framework of kernel units with fixed and variable widths. We give conditions on kernels with fixed widths implying  universal approximation property and describe behavior of  kernel stabilizers with changing widths and input dimensions. We illustrate our results by the example of Gaussian  kernel networks with fixed and varying widths.","","","IN","","","ITAT 2011. Conference on Theory and Practice of Information Technologies.

The Bayesian and Multiclass Common Spatial Patterns classifiers, which use solely interchannel covariance as input, are shown to be comparable in performance, while lagging behind the Multiclass Common Spatial Patterns classifier and the CTDA classifier, that is classifiers which additionally account for EEG frequency structure.

This paper discusses possibilities of using ontology matching techniques  for web services interoperability and composition, describes such  processes, explain their difficulties and propose a model for web service  composition based on suitable ontology matching techniques.","","","IN","","atestace2013ne","ICeND 2011.

A user usually spent a lot of time by building her reputation and  by creating a network of trusted/distrusted users. Without possibility of  seamless transfer from one trust management system to another, a user  is forced to build a new reputation/network of trusted users again. This  problem will become even more severe, as many current systems using  trust as a key factor influencing ability to communicate within a group  of users will be outdated and some of them even down.

To address this problem, we propose a fully declarative language for encoding preferences conditional on the current state of the world represented as a relation database instance. The language has constructs for various kinds of preferences, and we show how to interpret (sets of) its formulae; even sets of formulae that encode conflicting preferences. This leads to a flexible approach for specifying the most desirable choices of autonomous systems that act on behalf of their designers. Throughout the paper, we use an example of a control support system for a bank surveillance to motivate the need for our framework and to illustrate it.","","","IN","","ISBN 978-3-642-31603-6 (eBook)","IHCI 2011.

The wireless communication ability and the memory capacity of the computational units is severely restricted due to their minimal size. Moreover, the units originally have no identifiers and can only use simple communication protocols that cannot guarantee a reliable message delivery. In this work we concentrate on a so-called flying amorphous computer whose units are in a constant motion. The units are modelled by miniature RAMs communicating via radio. We design a distributed probabilistic communication protocol and an algorithm enabling a simulation of a RAM infinite time. The underlying algorithms make use of a number of original ideas having no counterpart in the classical theory of distributed computing. Our result is the first one showing computational universality of a flying amorphous computer.","","","IN","","UT ISI  ***","UC 2011. Unconventional Computation /10/.

The data upon which the model operates consist of typical outcomes of a tracer experiment – that is of simultaneously measured concentrations of radon and tracer gas concentrations (they do not have to have the same time resolution, however). The model has time-varying coefficients and it is casted as a state-space model. Hence, it allows for essentially non- or semi-parametric estimation of time-varying radon entry rate (RER) and air exchange rate (ACH) based on (extended) Kalman filtration. The state space model is carefully formulated so that it produces more or less automatically not only point estimates of both RER and ACH, but also their confidence intervals and/or test of various practically interesting hypotheses, including those related to the radon remedial action limits violations. Compared to our previously published work, the model explicitly accounts for several external influences and effectively corrects for their presence. These are tight to direct weather-related influences influencing pressure balance, as well as to (functional) relation between ACH and RER. To this account, we will present alternative to a “free” model which assumes that true ACH and RER dynamics are independent. It will introduce various types of explicitly specified ACH to RER dependencies, including those being based on linear functionals of ACH. We will use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of structural parameters of the state-space.","","","BB","","kopie je autorova, az bude kniha dodá lepší","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","","","","2-s2.0-84896415178","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0199324","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Though evolutionary algorithms are the by far most frequent approach to optimization tasks in that domain, they are challenged by mixing continuous and discrete variables, and especially by a large number of constraints. The paper describes the various kinds of encountered constraints, and explains constraint handling in GENACAT, one of evolutionary optimization systems developed specifically for catalyst optimization. In particular, it is shown that the interplay between cardinality constraints and linear equality and inequality constraints allows GENACAT to efficienlty determine the set of feasible solutions, and to split the original optimization task into a sequence of discrete and continuous optimization. Finally, the genetic operations employed in the discrete optimization are sketched, among which crossover is based on an assumption about the importance of the choice of sets of continuous variables in the cardinality constraints.","","","IN","","UT ISI  *** vyšlo též na CD, ISBN 978-1-4503-0557-0","GECCO 2011.

In what follows, we introduce and analyze possibilistic distributions and measures taking values in finite upper-valued possibilistic lattices, so that only for finite sets of such values their supremum is defined. For infinite sets of values of the finite lattice in question we apply the idea of the so called Monte-Carlo method: sample at random and under certain conditions a large enough finite subset of the infinite set in question, and take the supremum over this finite sample set as a ""good enough"" estimation of the undefined supremum of the infinite set. A number of more or less easy to prove assertions demonstrate the conditions when and in which sense the quality of the results obtained by replacing non-existing or non-accessible supremum values by their random estimations tend to the optimum results supposing that the probabilistic qualities of the statistical estimations increase as demanded by Monte-Carlo methods.","","","BA","","UT ISI","ECSQARU 2011.

Notes began to circulate, and the first public analysis of the proof was performed by Sobel (1987). Only after Gödel's death, in the third volume of his collected works (Gödel, 1995), was the proof finally published. It is just one page, preceded by an extensive and very informative introduction by Adams (Gödel, 1995). The volume also contains notes from Gödel's Nachlass, dated 1940, containing his first drafts of the proof. Presently, there exist several papers on the topic, including two extremely interesting monographs (Sobel, 2004; Fitting, 2002). A very important variant of Gödel's system, resulting from the first criticisms made of it, was generated by Anderson (1990). Anderson's variant will play an important role in this chapter. Gödel is famous for his completeness and incompleteness theorems as well as for his work with set theory, so his ontological proof has never received the same attention. The proof belongs to the family of ontological arguments, that is to say, arguments that try to establish the existence of God by relying only on pure logic. Such arguments were presented by Anselm (1033–1109), Descartes (1598–1650), Leibniz (1646–1716), and others, and Gödel is known to have studied particularly Leibniz's works (the two books mentioned earlier are recommended for information on the old ontological proofs and their relation to Gödel's proof).","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2012","","10.1017/CBO9780511974236.017","","2-s2.0-84899989559","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0198591","","1","","","","","","","","","",""

Such constructions have been known only in the case of width 2 and in very restricted cases of bounded width. In our previous work, we have introduced a so-called richness condition which is, in a certain sense, sufficient for a set to be a hitting set for read-once branching programs of width 3. In this paper, we prove that, for a suitable constant C, any almost (C log n)-wise independent set satisfies this richness condition. Hence, we achieve an explicit polynomial time construction of a hitting set for read-once branching programs of width~3 with the acceptance probability greater than 12/13 by using the result due to Alon et al. (1992).","","","IN","UT WOS nezjištěno","UT ISI *** hodui2015 šíma *** excelent2014","CSR 2011.  International Computer Science Symposium in Russia /6./.

The estimates are based on a flexible Box-Cox-t (BCT) family and the semiparametric GAMLSS approach, Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2006). The estimates show that the BMI distribution became increasingly right skewed over the years covered by our model. The rate of change of the BMI decile curves varied greatly over time and across gender and ethnicity. The BMI deciles of white men and women experienced upswings after the two world wars and downswings during the Great Depression and also decelerated after 1970. However, among African Americans the pattern is different during the first half of the century with men's rate of increase in BMI values decreasing substantially and that of females remaining constant at a relatively high level until the Second World War. After the war, though, the rate of change of BMI values of blacks came to resemble that of whites.","","V článku je odhadnut vývoj tvaru populačního rozdělení BMI dospělé US populace v rozmezí kohort dle roku narození 1882-1986. Odhadnuta je dynamika percentilů popisujících tvar celého rozdělení BMI, a to stratifikovaně, dle etnika a pohlaví. Odhady jsou založeny na flexibilním Box-Coxově-t (BCT) modelu a semiparametrickém GAMLSS přístupu, Rigby a Stasinopoulos (2006). Kromě detailní charakterizace průběhu zvyšování šikmosti populačního BMI rozdělení z odhadů plynou různá nová zjištění o dynamice deformace tvaru BMI distribuce, zejména po obou světových válkách. Jasně patrná je také stagnace celkového posunu BMI k vyšším hodnotám během hospodářské krize. Zrychlený nárůst po 2. sv. válce začíná zpomalovat po roce 1970. Zajímavé jsou také detailní srovnání mezi pohlavími a etniky, jež se vzhledem k BMI. Dynamika změn BMI rozdělení se mezi nimi dosti liší.","BB","vyšlo též jako CESifo Working Paper, 3132 - sysno 0346155","hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2012","15","10.1016/j.ehb.2011.03.005","wos:000292625700002","2-s2.0-79958173629","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0197659","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Our results show that there is an infinite hierarchy of cognitive systems. Within this hierarchy, there are systems achieving and trespassing the human intelligence level. We will argue that, formally, from a computation viewpoint the human level intelligence is upper-bounded by the Sigma-two class of the arithmetical hierarchy.

Here we propose information gain, model-based measure of the rate of success of individual methods. This measure presupposes that observed signals arise as Boolean superposition of base signals with noise. For the case whereby a method does not provide parameters necessary for information gain calculation we introduce the procedure for their estimation. Using an extended version of the ”Bars Problem” generation of typical synthetics data for such a task, we show that our measure is sensitive to all types of data model parameters and attains its maximum, when best fit is achieved.","","","IN","","UTISI *** e-ISBN 978-3-642-20282-7","ICANNGA'2011.

For comparison, connectivity matrices for multivariate linear Gaussian surrogate data preserving the correlations, but removing any nonlinearity are generated. Subsequent binarization with multiple thresholds generate graphs corresponding to linear and full nonlinear interactions. The effect of neglecting nonlinearity is then assessed by comparing the values of a range of graph-theoretical measures evaluated for both types of graphs. Statistical comparisons suggest a potential effect of nonlinearity on the local measures - clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality. A subsequent quantitative comparison shows that this effect is practically negligible when compared to the intersubject variability. Further, on the group-average graph level, the nonlinearity effect is unnoticeable.","","","BB","","hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2012","6","10.1063/1.3553181","wos:000289149100019","2-s2.0-79953282172","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0196837","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigates approaches for efficient approximations of the bilinear form $c^*A^{-1}b$. Equivalently, we wish to approximate the scalar value $c^*x$, where $x$ solves the linear system $Ax = b$. Here the matrix $A$ can be very large or its elements can be too costly to compute so that $A$ is not explicitly available and it is used only in the form of the matrix-vector product. Therefore a direct method is not an option. For $A$ Hermitian positive definite, $b^*A^{-1}b$ can be efficiently approximated as a by-product of the conjugate-gradient iterations, which is mathematically equivalent to the matching moment approximations computed via the Gauss–Christoffel quadrature. We propose a new method using the biconjugate gradient iterations which is applicable to the general complex case. The proposed approach is compared with existing ones using analytic arguments and numerical experiments.","","","BA","","atestace2013ano *** hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2012","5","10.1137/090753723","wos:000289973500005","2-s2.0-79957583077","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0196736","","0;1","","","","","","","","","",""

We study robust estimation mainly for the context of heteroscedasticity or high dimension, which are up-to-date topics of current econometrics. We describe a modification of linear regression resistant to heteroscedasticity and study its computational aspects. For a robust version of the instrumental variables estimator we propose an asymptotic test of heteroscedasticity. Further we describe robust statistical methods for dimension reduction and classification analysis. We propose the robust quadratic classification analysis based on a new minimum weighted covariance determinant (MWCD) estimator. In general the robust methods based on down-weightening less reliable observations are resistant to outlying values (outliers) and insensitive to the assumption of Gaussian normal distribution of the data. The methods are illustrated on econometric data examples.","","","BB","DOI nezjištěno","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","1","","wos:000303301400005","2-s2.0-84859460598","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0196538","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The author has introduced the  scalar score, a scalar inference function, which reflects main features of a continuous probability distribution and which is simple. Its  simplicity makes it possible to introduce new relevant numerical characteristics of continuous distributions. The t-mean and score  variance are descriptions of distributions without the drawbacks of the mean and variance, which may not exist even in cases of regular  distributions. Their sample counterparts appear to be alternative descriptions of the observed data. The scalar score itself appears to be  a new mathematical tool, which could be used in solving traditional statistical problems for models far from the normal one, skewed  and heavy-tailed.","","","BB","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2012","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0196532","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

For a special laboratory Couette-Taylor bioreactor with cylindrical geometry, we reached reliable simulation results using a steady-state Eulerian approach and the finite difference scheme.

METHODS: We placed TVT-S inserters bilaterally in 13 embalmed and five fresh frozen female bodies. After dissection, we measured distances from the obturator bundle. RESULTS: In embalmed bodies, the mean distance of TVT-S from the obturator bundle was 2.83 cm (standard deviation (SD) 0.87 cm) on the left, 2.92 cm (SD 1.24 cm) on the right. Perforation of the fascia of obturator internus muscle occurred in 38.5%. In fresh frozen bodies, results were fundamentally similar (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There is a risk of injury to the obturator bundle and urinary bladder during TVT-S; however, there is a significant risk of inserting the TVT-S inserter outside the obturator internus muscle (into the lesser pelvis). The position of TVT-S does not change significantly after legs mal-positioning.","","","FK","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2012","4","10.1007/s00192-010-1239-5","wos:000286467700017","2-s2.0-79951642766","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0196401","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, the face localization in images is carried out by detecting symmetric areas in the images. Symmetry is measured between two neighboring rectangular areas in the images using a new robust correlation coefficient, which down-weights regions in the face violating the symmetry. Raw images of faces without usual preliminary transformations are considered. The robust correlation coefficient based on the least weighted squares regression yields very promising results also in the localization of such faces, which are not entirely symmetric. Standard methods of statistical machine learning are applied for comparison. The robust correlation analysis can be applicable to other problems of forensic anthropology.","","","BB","","hodnoceniui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2012","2013","","10.1111/j.1556-4029.2011.02000.x","wos:000307011500001","2-s2.0-84860207121","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0195344","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The commonly used linear correlation bears an implicit assumption of Gaussianity of the dependence structure. To assess the suitability of linear correlation and the general potential of nonlinear FC measures, we present a framework for testing and estimating the deviation from Gaussianity by comparing mutual information in the data and its Gaussianized counterpart. We apply this method to 24 sessions of human resting state fMRI. While the group-level tests confirmed non-Gaussianity in the FC, the quantitative assessment revealed that the portion of mutual information neglected by linear correlation is relatively minor - on average only about 5% of the total mutual information. We conclude that for this type of data, practical relevance of nonlinear methods trying to improve over linear correlation is limited by the fact that the data are almost Gaussian.","","","FH","","hodui2015 *** cena10 *** excelent2014 *** excelent2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2011","22","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.08.042","wos:000286302000044","2-s2.0-78650180896","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0195122","","0;1","","","","","","","","","",""

The appropriate tool for its study is matrix theory, but applications usually involve solving huge systems of linear equations or eigenvalue problems, and geometry can help in visualizing the behaviour of the problem. In many cases, solving such systems may depend more on the distribution of non-zero coefficients than on their values, so graph theory is also useful. The author has discovered a method that in many (symmetric) cases helps to split huge systems into smaller parts. Many readers will welcome this book, from undergraduates to specialists in mathematics, as well as non-specialists who only use mathematics occasionally, and anyone who enjoys geometric theorems. It acquaints the reader with basic matrix theory, graph theory and elementary Euclidean geometry so that they too can appreciate the underlying connections between these various areas of mathematics and computer science.","","","BA","","hodui2015 *** excelent2014","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2011","3","10.1017/CBO9780511973611","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0195050","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to compare serum antibodies against genitourinary infectious agents between PCa patients and controls with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH).

Furthermore, in the case of the agglomerative method we also applied a single linkage and complete linkage clustering as a criterion function. Collection 20 Newsgroups, a binary vector representation of e-mail messages, was used for comparing the methods. Experiments with document clustering have proved that, from the point of view of entropy and purity, the direct method provides the best results.

Their main applications concern clustering  objects characterized by quantitative variables. For this case various  coefficients for clustering evaluation and determination of cluster numbers  have been proposed. However, in some areas, i.e., for segmentation of Internet  users, the variables are often nominal or ordinal as their origin in questionnaire  responses. That is why we are dealing with the evaluation criteria  for the case of categorical variables here. The criteria based on variability  measures are proposed. Instead of variance as a measure for quantitative  variables, three measures for nominal variables are considered: the variability  measure based on a modal frequency, Gini’s coefficient of mutability, and the  entropy. The proposed evaluation criteria are applied to a real-dataset.","","","IN","","UTISI  *** zmena BB na IN","AWIC 2011. Atlantic Web Intelligence Conference /7./.

The increasing number of CSs and nomenclatures requires designing of various conversion tools for transfer between main CSs. We present the so-called LIM filler module and the HL7 broker, which are parts of the SIP, playing the role of such conversion tools. The analysis of suitability and usability of individual terminological thesauri has been started by mapping of clinical contents of the Minimal Data Model for Cardiology to various terminological CSs.

Due to the metric postulates (reflexivity, non-negativity, symmetry and triangle inequality), a metric similarity allows to build a metric index above the database which can be subsequently used for efficient (fast) similarity search. On the other hand, the metric postulates limit the domain experts (providers of the similarity measure) in similarity modeling. In this paper we propose an alternative non-metric method of indexing for efficient similarity search. The requirement on metric is replaced by the requirement on fuzzy similarity satisfying the transitivity property with a tuneable fuzzy conjunctor. We also show a duality between the fuzzy approach and the metric one.","","","IN","","atestace2013ne","FQAS 2009. International Conference on Flexible Query Answering Systems /8./.

Experimental results on both synthetic and real-life data show interesting behavior (classification accuracy) of the classifier in comparison with other well-known classifiers.","","","IN","","UT ISI","ISDA 2010.

This algorithm was introduced in [R. Bru, J. Marín, J. Mas, and M. Tůma, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 30 (2008), pp. 2302–2318]. The improvements are based on a deeper understanding of the inverse Sherman–Morrison (ISM) decomposition, and they provide a new insight into the BIF decomposition. In particular, it is shown that a slight algorithmic reformulation of the basic algorithm implies that the direct and inverse factors numerically influence each other even without any dropping for incompleteness. Algorithmically, the nonsymmetric version of the improved BIF algorithm is formulated. Numerical experiments show very high robustness of the incomplete implementation of the algorithm used for preconditioning nonsymmetric linear systems.","","","BA","","cena10 *** grant M100300902 je zahraniční spolupráce AV *** excelent2014","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2010","2011","","10.1137/090747804","wos:000285933400009","2-s2.0-79251493012","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0191385","","0;1","","","","","","","","","",""

It is well-known that while structure-based preconditioners can be very useful, excessive memory demands can limit their usefulness. Here we present an improved strategy that considers the individual entries of the system matrix and restricts small entries to contributing to fewer levels of fill than the largest entries. Using symmetric positive-definite problems arising from a wide range of practical applications, we show that the use of variable levels of fill can yield incomplete Cholesky factorization preconditioners that are more efficient than those resulting from the standard level-based approach. Further numerical results demonstrate that our level-based approach can lead to much sparser but efficient incomplete factorization preconditioners.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2012","","10.1007/s10543-010-0299-8","wos:000291482000008","2-s2.0-79958190216","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0191383","","1;0","","","","","","","","","",""

The tightness of their relation is studied by the means of recently introduced measure called the average inaccuracy. This measure is defined as a standardized average difference between the upper and the lower bound for the Bayes error under given entropy. It can be applied to any strictly concave f-entropy and used to evaluate its relation to the Bayes error. However, due to a complex form of the formula of the average inaccuracy, it is difficult to compare the average inaccuracies of most f-entropies analytically. We propose a smooth approximation of the lower bound for the Bayes error under given f-entropy that simplifies the formula. We show that under this approximation, the quadratic entropy has the tightest relation to the Bayes error among f-entropies.","","","BB","","atestace2013ne","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2010","2011","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0191334","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we use a numerically stable way of generating the values of normalized orthogonal polynomials on a discrete set of points; we use “the Arnoldi algorithm with reorthogonalization”, which is the key ingredient of our approach. The generated vectors can then be considered orthogonal also in finite precision arithmetic (up to a small inaccuracy proportional to machine precision). We then use the special algebraic structure of the covariance matrix to find algebraically the inversion of the matrix of the system of normal equations. Therefore, we do not need to compute numerically the inversion of the covariance matrix and we do not even need to solve the system of normal equations numerically. Some consequences of putting the algorithms mentioned into practice are discussed.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2010","2011","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0191129","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This gives rise to the first mechanisable technique that can, in practice, formally verify safety properties of non-trivial continuous-time stochastic hybrid systems - without resorting to point-wise discretisation.Moreover, being based on arbitrary abstractions computed by tools for the analysis of non-probabilistic hybrid systems, improvements in effectivity of such tools directly carry over to improvements in effectivity of the technique we describe. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on a number of case studies, tackled using a prototypical implementation.","","","IN","","","CAV 2010.

This basin of attraction is ensured by a Lyapunov-like polynomial function that we compute using an interval based branch-and-relax algorithm. This algorithm relaxes the necessary conditions on the coefficients of the Lyapunov-like function to a system of linear interval inequalities that can then be solved exactly. It iteratively refines these relaxations in order to ensure that, whenever a nondegenerate solution exists, it will eventually be found by the algorithm. Application of an implementation to a range of benchmark problems shows the usefulness of the approach.","","","IN","","hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2010","2011","4","10.1137/090749955","wos:000281673500009","2-s2.0-77958536851","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0191083","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Conductors can lose their tensile strength due to the adverse effects of conductor aging caused by annealing. Although the loss of conductor strength is gradual, it accumulates over time and increases the probability of outages and blackouts. Therefore, it is important to keep track of conductor temperatures over time and in space, in order to identify segments of power transmission network that may require more close attention, repairs, or reinforcements.

Lattice-valued entropy function is defined in the common pattern for both the orderings, naturally leading to different entropy values for the particular ordering applied in the case under consideration.

There have been a number of component frameworks developed for this purpose and some of them have already become well-established in this area. However, although the component frameworks share basic concepts and the general approach, they substantially differ in the range of supported features and maturity. This makes relatively difficult to select the right component framework and thus poses a significant obstacle in adoption of the component-based development for real-time embedded systems. To provide an overview, we present a survey in this paper, which illustrates distinguishing features of selected modern component-based frameworks for real-time embedded systems. The survey identifies features which are important for building systems from components in this area and compares these frameworks with respect to these features.","","","JC","","","CBSE 2010.

Since the substantial information about the system is  captured by the use-cases, it comes as a natural idea to generate from these descriptions  the implementation of the system (at least partially). However, the fact that  the use-cases are in a natural language makes this task extremely difficult. In this  paper, we describe a model-driven tool allowing code of a system to be generated  from use-cases in plain English. The tool is based on the model-driven development  paradigm, which makes it modular and extensible, so as to allow for use-cases in  multiple language styles and generation for different component frameworks.","","","JC","","","SNDP 2010.

One model (based on artificial mirror neurons) is used for mining and capturing the syntax of the recognized part of the environment while the second one (based on neural nets) for its semantics. Jointly, the models support algorithmic processes underlying phenomena similar in important aspects to higher cognitive functions such as imitation learning and the development of communication, language, thinking, and consciousness.","","","IN","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2010","2011","","10.4018/jssci.2010070105","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0189240","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The second kind are heuristic methods, designed so that they correlate with prediction error. Both methods are compared on four kinds of parametric regression models using real-world data. This is a work in progress, that is why transductive inference has not been implemented yet, only one dataset has been used, and the comparison has been implemented for two kinds of regression models, so far: multilayer perceptron and support-vector regression.

However, they are frequently used without awareness of the difference between the numeric nature of knowledge obtained from data by neural network regression, and the symbolic nature of knowledge obtained by some other data mining methods. This paper explains that within the surrogate modelling approach, which plays an important role in this area, using numeric knowledge is justified. At the same time, it recalls the possibility to obtain symbolic knowledge from neural networks in the form of logical rules and describes a recently proposed method for the extraction of Boolean rules in disjunctive normal form. Both ways of using neural networks are illustrated on examples from this application area.","","","IN","","UT ISI","ITAT 2010. Conference on Theory and Practice of Information Technologies.

Specifically, we will deal with household and small+medium (HOU+SMC) size commercial customers. The model is suitable for disaggregation of various observed functionals of the observed consumption process into smaller pieces, e.g. disaggregation of sums across both individual customers and time into original components. This amounts to (semiparametric statistical) estimation of the individual pieces and/or subsequent synthesis into other functionals of interest. The model is built as a GAM (generalized additive model) with a nonlinear temperature response and it has quite rich dynamic component. We formulate the model first in generality and then we illustrate its behavior on real data from a large scale project.","","","JE","","hodui2015 malý","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2010","2011","","10.5772/9855","wos:000363693000018","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0188875","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a generalization of existing inverse methods that optimize emission daily totals. The core of the method is formed by the CMAQ adjoint model with SAPRC99 mechanism. Measurements from both ground–level stations (NO2 and O3), and satellites (retrieved columns of NO2 from GOME2 and OMI and the lowest layer of O3 retrieved from IASI) have been used as a data source for the inverse modeling procedure. The method can be used for detection of bias or errors in the emission model. It also can assist in development of data–driven emission model with location–specific time profiles of emissions. Different aspects of the method are illustrated on simulation experiments. Forecasting performance of the optimized model is evaluated for O3 and NO2 concentrations.","","","DG","","hodui2015 resler","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2010","2011","3","10.5094/APR.2010.036","wos:000208510000012","2-s2.0-79951879550","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0188873","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Next, we will illustrate how the state-space modeling and KF can be useful for solving practical problems from interesting real-life applications. Firstly, the state-space approach and KF estimation will be shown as a tool for estimation of time-varying parameters describing radon concentrations in houses, based on two underlying differential equations summarizing the radon and tracer dynamics. Secondly, we will show how the Kalman filtration can be useful for estimation of underlying growth curve of small children.

Chapter 8","","functional data analysis - spline smoothing - nonparametric regression - radon entry rate - air exchange rate","We present a methodology useful for estimation of radon entry  rate (RER) in buildings. General RER estimation is complicated by the presence of air exchange rate, which acts as a nuisance parameter. Nevertheless, RER can be estimated under various circumstances. One such a situation occurs when, in addition to the time series of radon concentrations, time series of some tracer concentrations is available. Here, we will present a simpler but flexible alternative to Kalman filtering approach, based on functional data analysis (FDA), Ramsay, Silverman (1997) methodology. It is built on spline smoothing of radon and tracer concentrations, subsequent estimation of their time derivatives and finally on solution of the underlying system of differential equations. The methodology is presented first in generality, and then with respect to practical implementation and computation. Then it is illustrated on real data.","","","BB","","PRINTISBN 978-1-61761-375-3 *** z ISBN  978-1-61728-995-8 lze koupit (asi elektronicky) jednotlivé kapitoly a je v RIV za K.J.","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2010","2012","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0187722","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The obesity disease and the obesity-related health problems should call the attention of researches working in the field of anthropology, epidemiology, genetics, etc. to this worldwide public health problem. The understanding of the aetiology is always the very first step in the prevention, control and cure process of the diseases. Therefore, this paper aimed to review systematically the literature exploring the role of genetic factors leading to obesity. Human genetic studies indicate that the obesity is largely determined by genetic factors. The main candidate genes of obesity as well as their polymorphisms in human populations are shortly summarized. Syndromes associated with obesity are reviewed in respect of the severity of this abnormal form of nutritional status.","","","EB","","atestace2013ne","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2010","2011","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0187454","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approach leads to a substantial decrease of time and costs of evaluation of the objective function, a property that is particularly attractive in evolutionary optimization. The paper recalls common strategies for using surrogate models in evolutionary optimization, and proposes two extensions to those strategies - extension to boosted surrogate models and extension to using a set of models. These are currently being implemented, in connection with surrogate modelling based on feed-forward neural networks, in a software tool for problem-tailored evolutionary optimization of catalytic materials. The paper presents results of experimentally testing already implemented parts and comparing boosted surrogate models with models without boosting, which clearly confirms the usefulness of both proposed extensions.","","","IN","","","ASMTA 2010.

Resting state networks (RSN) are defined by synchronisation of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal. Simultaneous EEG/fMRI has been previously used to study the neurophysiological signature of RSN by comparing EEG power with BOLD amplitude. We hypothesised that band-limited EEG power may be directly related to network specific functional connectivity (FC) of BOLD signal time courses, focusing on the default mode network (DMN). Analysing combined EEG/fMRI resting state data of 20 subjects, we showed network and frequency specific relation between RSN FC and EEG band-powers explaining 70% of DMN-FC variance, with partial correlations of DMN-FC to delta and beta power. The identified EEG pattern has been previously associated with increased alertness. The study opens a new perspective to EEG/fMRI correlation. Direct evidence was provided for a distinct neurophysiological correlate of DMN-FC.","","","FH","","cena10 v případě kolize uvést 6RP, nikoli záměr","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2010","2011","20","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.06.002","wos:000280818900026","2-s2.0-77955304578","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0187122","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we circumvent undecidability by providing an algorithm that can verify safety and provably terminates for all robust and safe problem instances. It need not necessarily terminate for problem instances that are unsafe or non-robust. A problem instance x is robust iff the given property holds not only for x itself, but also when x is perturbed a little bit. Since, in practice, well-designed hybrid systems are usually robust, this implies that the algorithm terminates for the cases occurring in practice. In contrast to earlier work, our result holds for a very general class of hybrid systems, and it uses a continuous time model.","","","IN","","","TAMC 2010.

Higher concentrations represent an increased individual risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. In a representative sample of the Czech population, a positive relation of hsCRP to BMI, a waist circumference and triglyceride concentration was documented. Substantial sex differences were found in its relationship to age. Whereas it is continuously increasing in men, this increase appears in women only after menopause. A substantial decrease of body weight and visceral fat volume by increased physical activity is accompanied by significant decrease of hsCRP in young obese women. We hypothesized that an increased concentration of hsCRP represents a certain marker of  proinflammatory status related to central obesity and triglyceride metabolism and it might be related to individual properties of monocytes in atherogenesis","","Koncentrace C-reaktivního proteinu analyzované vysoce sensitivní metodou (hsCRP) jsou známým markerem předčasné aterosklerózy.

We investigated if hyposmia is specific to narcolepsy with cataplexy (N-C) or if narcolepsy without cataplexy (NwC) is also associated with olfactory dysfunction. We studied olfactory function in two groups of patients: N-C group (n = 66), and NwC group (n = 17). As a control group we used published normative data for particular smell tests. Both patients with N-C and NwC had a significantly higher olfactory threshold and impaired odor identification. Our results show for the first time that narcolepsy without cataplexy, where the majority of cases have normal CSF hypocretin levels, is associated with olfactory dysfunction. It appears that also a partial loss of hypothalamic hypocretin neurons without a clear CSF level decrease can affect smell projection.","","","FH","","cena10 *** hodui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2010","2011","6","10.1016/j.sleep.2010.01.009","wos:000279424800010","2-s2.0-77953359910","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0185986","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

To assess actual changes in the expression of the GluN1 subunit and its isoforms, we measured absolute differences in the levels of mRNA/protein for panGluN1 (eight isoforms altogether) as well as the mRNA individual isoforms in the postmortem left/right hippocampus of patients with schizophrenia in comparison with non-psychiatric subjects. Our results suggest that NMDA-R hypofunction in schizophrenia might be selectively dependent on the dysregulation of GluN1 subunit expression, which exhibits a somewhat different expression in the left/right hippocampus of psychotic patients.","","","FL","","cena10","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2010","2011","8","10.1007/s11064-010-0145-z","wos:000278411000005","2-s2.0-77953231677","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0185943","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The main goal is to give the suitable formulation of mathematical model describing with sufficiently accuracy the TMJ and its function. The model is based on the theory of semi-coercive contact problems in linear elasticity, which leads to solving the variational inequality. The numerical solution is based on the finite element approximation of variational inequality corresponding to a generalized semi-coercive contact problem. The obtained numerical results will be discussed. Since the world is globalized new results from the bioinformatics and medical informatics play an important role. Therefore, the problem of an ""international global mutual language"" for surgeons in stomatology from different countries, and similarly in other branches in medicine, will be shortly discussed.","","","IN","","","ICCSA 2010.

We show that the algebraic error can be bounded by constructing an equilibrated Raviart-Thomas-Nédélec discrete vector field whose divergence is given by a proper weighting of the residual vector. Next, claiming that the discretization error and the algebraic one should be in balance, we construct stopping criteria for iterative algebraic solvers.Using this convenient balance, we also prove the efficiency of our a posteriori estimates; i.e., we show that they also represent a lower bound, up to a generic constant, for the overall energy error. A local version of this result is also stated. This makes our approach suitable for adaptive mesh refinement which also takes into account the algebraic error.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2010","2011","15","10.1137/08073706X","wos:000278576300022","2-s2.0-77953840991","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0185458","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

It leads to the Leibniz hierarchy; a classification of logics based on generalized equivalences. We perform an analogous abstract study of non-classical logics based on generalized implications. It yields the hierarchy of implicational logics which expands Leibniz hierarchy. The notion of implicational semilinear logic is then naturally introduced as a property of the implication, namely a logic is an implicational semilinear logic iff it has an implication and is complete w.r.t. the matrices where this implication induces a linear order, a property which is satisfied by majority of fuzzy logics. This hierarchy is then restricted to the semilinear case obtaining a classification that encompasses almost all the known examples of fuzzy logics and suggests new directions for research.","","","BA","","cena09 *** hodnoceniui2015","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2010","2011","19","10.1007/s00153-010-0178-7","wos:000277246000001","2-s2.0-84871950551","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0184955","","0;1","","","","","","","","","",""

For studying their interactions we propose a complementary approach combining wavelet bispectral analysis and information theory. We show how these methods uncover the interacting properties and reveal the nature, strength and direction of coupling. Wavelet bispectral analysis is generalized as a technique for detecting instantaneous phase-time dependence for the case of two or more coupled nonlinear oscillators whereas the information theory approach can uncover the directionality of coupling and extract driver-response relationships in complex systems. We generate bivariate time-series numerically to mimic typical situations that occur in real measured data, apply both methods to the same time-series and discuss the results. The approach is applicable quite generally to any system of coupled nonlinear oscillators.","","","FH","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2010","2011","6","10.1103/PhysRevE.81.036207","wos:000276199400032","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0184677","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We faced several issues during implementation of the CoCoME assignment in SOFA 2.0. Most notably, the architecture was modified in order to improve clarity of the design – in particular, the hierarchical bus was replaced by two separate buses and the Inventory component was restructured.

This, however, makes BPMN unsuitable for direct execution. On the other hand, the Business Process Executable Language (BPEL), which is directly executable, is a natural choice for implementing business processes, but its use requires programming skills. This dichotomy can be solved by transforming BPMN into BPEL. However, the existing transformation methods have a common problem which is either incompleteness or loss of intentions, which makes BPEL difficult to modify and debug as well as to propagate changes back to BPMN. We present an approach to address this problem by enhancing an existing transformation algorithm to provide a complete transformation while preserving a large set of intentions expressed in the BPMN description, which makes it suitable for model-driven development.","","","JC","","cena09 kolize09 grant TEA/EUREKA(EU) OSIRIS S!2023 nahrada M (Sysno 0317127 zruseno)","ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering Research, Management and Applications /6./.

Following seasonal and postseasonal median values were measured in patients with SAR in comparison with control patients: LTB4: 131 and 90 pg/mL vs 80 and 79 pg/mL, P < .001 and P = .03, respectively; LTE4: 122 and 86 pg/mL vs 76 and 74 pg/mL, P < .001and P = .02, respectively. Five months after the pollen season, the concentrations of LTB4 and LTE4 decreased with respect to their seasonal values (P < .001).

Both approaches are based on the general updates of incomplete LU decompositions recently introduced in (SISC 2007; 29(5):1918–1941) and they may be directly embedded into nonlinear algebraic solvers. The first approach uses a new model of partial matrix estimation to compute the updates. The second approach exploits separability of function components to apply the updated preconditioner via function evaluations. Experiments with matrix-free implementations of test problems show that both techniques offer useful, robust and black-box solution strategies.","","","BA","","cena09","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2010","2011","7","10.1002/nla.695","wos:000285795400007","2-s2.0-78649654096","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0182494","","0;1","","","","","","","","","",""

Pituitary function was monitored regularly at 6m intervals. Normoprolactinaemia was achieved in 37% of the patients who discontinued DA and in 43% of patients who continued DA treatment after LGK irradiation. The median time to prolactin normalization after discontinuation of DA was 96m. After LGK the prolactinoma stopped growing or decreased in size in all but one patient (97%).

This measure is derived using classical informational theory results. Neural network based Boolean factor analysis method efficiency is  demonstrated using this measure, both when applied to Bars Problem benchmark data and to real textual data. It is shown that when applied to the well defined Bars Problem data, Boolean factor analysis provides informational gain close to its maximum, i.e. the latent structure of the testing images data was revealed with the maximal accuracy. For scientific origin real textual data the informational gain provided by the method happened to be much higher comparing to that based on human experts proposal.","","Je navržena univerzální míra - informační zisk - pro vyhodnocení správnosti a kvality rozkladu vícerozměrných binárních signálů pomocí booleovské faktorové analýzy pomocí neuronové sítě.

A typical solution is to create an artificial environment for the component such that composition of them forms a runnable program that can be model-checked. While it is possible to create a universal environment that performs all possible sequences and interleavings of calls of the component’s methods, for practical purposes it is sufficient to capture in this way just the use of the component in a particular software system – this idea is expressed by the paradigm of assume-guarantee reasoning. In this paper, we present our approach to assume-guarantee-based verification of software systems in the context of the SOFA 2 component framework.","","Klíčový problém v modulárním model checkingu softwarových systémů je to, že typické model checkery akceptují pouze uzavřené systémy (spustitelné programy) a proto není možné použít model checking na komponentu přímo.

V důsledku toho nejsou typické výkonnostní modely softwarových služeb, založené na předpokladu konstantní režie, dostatečně přesné pro predikci výkonnosti v reálném prostředí.

First, both the state-of-the-art knowledge and the tools are rapidly evolving. Second, there are no comprehensive textbooks covering certain topics, especially code analysis. In this paper, we share our experience with teaching two courses. The first is focused on classics of modeling and verification of software and hardware systems (LTS, LTL, equivalences, etc.), while the other one involves topics related to automated analysis of program code. We hope that other lecturers can benefit from our experience to improve their courses.","","Výuka formálních metod je z mnoha důvodů nelehký úkol. Za prvé, jak znalosti v oblasti tak softwarové nástroje se rychle vyvíjejí. Za druhé, k dispozici nejsou učební texty, které by pokrývaly určitá témata, zvlášť v oblasti analýzy kódu. V tomto článku se chceme podělit o zkušenosti s výukou dvou přednášek. První je zaměřena na klasiku v oblasti modelování a verifikace softwarových a hardwarových systémů (LTS, LTL, ekvivalence, atd.), zatímco druhá zahrnuje témata týkající se automatické analýzy kódu.

However, the current situation in usage of component systems is that most of the widely used systems are flat ones while hierarchical systems (which are more advanced and elaborated) are rather ignored by industry. In our view, the situation is caused by a poor support of features necessary to build real-life applications using hierarchical component systems. In the paper, based on several real-life case-studies, we show a set of typical architecture patterns, which have to be supported by hierarchical component systems, and also we evaluate how these patterns are supported by current systems.","","Tvorba aplikací založených na softwarových komponentách se stala široce uznávanou programovací technikou.

Dle našeho názoru je tento stav způsoben tím, že existující hierarchické komponentové systémy nedostatečné podporují mechanismy potřebné pro implementaci reálných aplikací. Na základě několika provedených případových studií představujeme v tomto článku sadu typických programovacích technik, které je třeba podporovat v hierarchických komponentových systémech.

It is desirable to preserve a relation between the original structure of the source code of a component and the extracted specification; in particular, this is important for both user comprehension and for interpretation of results of any further formal verification. Even though the reverse engineering techniques providing behavior specification have already been applied on object oriented software and components, none of them targets the interplay of both the externally and internally triggered activities on the component’s provided and required interfaces from a single perspective. This paper targets the problem in the scope of Behavior Protocols and components given as a set of Java classes accompanied with information on component boundaries. To demonstrate viability of the proposed approach, this technique has been partially applied in the JAbstractor tool for the SOFA component model.","","Jednou z výzev při komponentizaci aplikací je extrakce specifikace chování komponent z jejich implementace.

Especially, when the components come from different vendors worldwide. In order to do so, an appropriate formalism for behavior specification of components is necessary. We propose a formalism of threaded behavior protocols, which-unlike most other formalisms-allows for both analysis on the formal level (correctness and substitutability checking) and reasoning about conformance of a specification and the actual implementation. Moreover, the formalism is designed to be simple enough and to directly support constructs known from implementation languages (e.g., method calls, threads, synchronized blocks), so that it is easy to use by a nonprofessional.","","Zajištění kompatibility komponent je nutnou podmínkou vývoje spolehlivých komponentových systémů, hlavně pokud jednotlivé komponenty pochází od různých výrobců z různých zemí.

Navrhujeme formalismus Threaded Behavior Protocols, který na rozdíl od většiny jiných umožňuje analýzu na formální úrovni (správnost a substituovatelnost komponent) i analýzu vztahu specifikace a konkrétní implementace.

Each component system has its specifics and particularities that reflect its focus and the application domain it is intended for. Although important, the diversity of component systems leads to a number of problems including having different tools for each systems, unnecessary duplication of functionality and problems with integration when several domains are to be targeted. Based on categorization of component application domains, we propose a ""meta-component system"", which provides a software product line for creating custom component systems. We focus especially on the deployment and execution environment, which is where most diversities are found. We demonstrate the usage of the ""meta-component system"" and propose how it is to be realized by two core concepts of SOFA 2, namely connector generator and microcomponents.","","Komponentové systémy se staly široce používanou technologií v mnoha aplikačních doménách.

Rozšíření je ilustrováno na případové studii v materiálových vědách.","IN","","UTISI","ICONIP 2009. International Conference on Neural Information Processing /16./.

The approach is to approximate how close a point is to being an initial point, of an error trajectory using a real-valued quality function, and then to use numerical optimisation to search for all optimum of this function. The function is computed by running simulations, where information coming from abstractions computed by a verification algorithm is exploited to determine whether a simulation looks promising and should be continued or cancelled. This information becomes more reliable as the abstraction becomes more refined. We thus interleave falsification and verification attempts.","","Popisujeme algoritmus, který falsifikuje bezpečnostní vlastnosti hybridních systémů, tj. algoritmus, který hledá trajektorie do bezpečnostního stavu.

Among the most important we can rank SNOMED CT, ICD-10, LOINC and others. The increasing number of classification systems and nomenclatures requires designing of various conversion tools for transfer between main classification systems. Metathesauri are designed to monitor and connect information from various heterogeneous sources. UMLS is the most extensive project nowadays. The analysis of suitability and usability of individual terminological thesauri has been started by mapping of clinical contents of the Minimal Data Model for Cardiology (MDMC) to various terminological classification systems. Close co-operation with physicians is essential for solving mapping problems.  We have compared also how well attributes of MDMC are recorded in textual medical reports and in medical reports recorded by means of the ADAMEK software application.","","Článek popisuje několik klasifikačních systémů, které by měly podporovat sdílenou zdravotní péči při cestování.

Jsou navrhovány metatezaury, které monitorují a spojují informace z různých heterogenních zdrojů. Nejrozsáhlejším současným projektem je UMLS. Analýzu využitelnosti a použitelnosti jednotlivých terminologických thesaurů jsme začali mapováním klinického kontextu Minimálního datového modelu pro kardiologii (MDMK) na různé terminologické klasifikační systémy. Úzká spolupráce s lékaři je pro řešení problémů při mapování velice důležitá.

With this aim we have examined local synchronization using novel measure of coarse-grained information rate (CIR) in 8 EEG signals recorded at different cortical areas in 44 patients with paranoid schizophrenia. The values of local synchronization that could reflect sensitization related changes in EEG activities of cortical sites were found significantly correlated with psychometric measures of epileptic-like symptoms (LSCL-33) in 7 (of 8) EEG channels (r in the range from 0.307 to 0.374, p<0.05). Results of this study provide first supportive evidence for the relationship between local synchronization measured by CIR and epileptic-like symptoms in schizophrenia.","","Stávající poznatky ukazují, že změny v synchronizaci neuronálních aktivit, které se vztahují ke kindlingu a sensitizaci mohou být lépe pochopeny prostřednictvím nelineárních metod.

We consider two arithmetical properties of PRA and see what their consequences in the modal logic IL(PRA) are. These properties are reflected in the so-called Beklemishev Principle B, and Zambella's Principle Z. We prove a frame condition for B, and that Z follows from a restricted form of B.

They become dominant and, therefore, prevent successful factors search. To eliminate these attractors we propose a special unlearning procedure. This second unlearning procedure provides the suppression of factors with  the largest attraction basins which dominate after suppression of global  spurious attractors and prevent the recall of other factors. The origin of the global spurious attractors and the efficiency of the unlearning procedures are investigated in the present paper.","","Zvláštností použití Hopfieldovy neuronové sítě ve funkci booleovského faktorového analyzátoru je výskyt dvou globálních lživých traktorů, jež jsou dominantní, a proto brání úspěšnému vyhledávání faktorů.

Druhý krok odučení umožňuje potlačení faktorů s největší oblastí atraktivity, které dominují po potlačení rušivých globálních atraktorů a brání tak nalezení dalších faktorů. Analyzován je původ globálních lživých traktorů a účinnost odučovacích postupů.","IN","","cena10","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2010","2011","","10.1007/978-3-642-05177-7_26","wos:000274200800026","2-s2.0-74049105595","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0176757","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many realistic queries cannot be matched by individual services and only a combination of several services can satisfy such queries. Allowing service combinations or proper compositions of primitive services as a valid match introduces problems such as unwanted side-effects (i.e., producing an effect that is not requested), effect duplications (i.e., producing some effect more than once) and contradictory effects (i.e., producing both an effect and its negation). Also the ranking of matched services has to be reconsidered for service combinations.

Within 3 months every hypertensive is to start taking mainly the best tolerated drugs with the highest organ protection and evidence - ACEI, resp. ARB. CCBs are suitable as the second drug and thiazide diuretics as the third drug for a triple therapy. Due to a deficit in hypertension control it is more realistic to achieve at least the usual goal BP values in most hypertensives and to treat them also for other risk factors dyslipidemia and diabetes. The formalization of GL for PC could help to GPs. It enables calculation of the total cardiovascular risk according to the SCORE project, evaluation of subclinical organ damages and quick finding of a suitable monotherapy and combination therapy.","","IN","","cena09 *** atestace2013ne","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2009","2010","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0176523","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our motivation for testing heuristics on the family of bipartite graphs is the rank-one decomposition of BN2O networks. A BN2O network is a Bayesian network having the structure of a bipartite graph with all edges directed from the top level toward the bottom level and where all conditional probability tables are noisy-or gates. After applying the rank-one decomposition, which adds an extra level of auxiliary nodes in between the top and bottom levels, and after removing simplicial nodes of the bottom level we get so called BROD graph. This is an undirected bipartite graph. It is desirable for efficiency of the inference to find a triangulation of the BROD graph having the sum of table sizes for all cliques of the triangulated graph as small as possible. From this point of view, the minfill heuristics perform in average better than other tested heuristics (minwidth, h1, and mcs).","","V článku jsou prezentovány výsledky provnání různých heuristik pro triangulaci bipartitních grafů.

The RCWA method assumes a specific form of gratings which enables a straightforward separation of space variables. Using Fourier expansions, the solutions of the resulting systems of ordinary differential equations for the Fourier amplitudes can after truncation be written in a form of matrix functions, with an elegant formulation of the linear algebraic problem for integrating constants. In our text we present derivation of the RCWA method, we formulate open questions which still need to be addressed and discuss perspectives of efficient solution of the related highly structured linear algebraic problems. A detailed understanding of the RCWA method for the two-dimensional grating is in our opinion necessary for development of successful generalization of the method to practical problems.","","Rozptyl světla na periodickém povrchu představuje důležitý problém s mnoha fyzikálními a inženýrskými aplikacemi.

Pravděpodobnost pokrytí skutečného p konfidenčním intervalem nemůže být na celém intervalu [0, 1] rovna předepsané nominální hladině spolehlivosti 1-alpha. Odtud vyplývají dilemata (musí být pravděpodobnost pokrytí vždy alespoň 1-alpha, nebo je lepší aproximovat 1-alpha z obou stran?) a množství návrhů, jak konfidenční interval konstruovat. Nyní bude výklad rozšířen o zobecnění ""obyčejných"" konfidenčních intervalů, která dosažení konstantní pravděpodobnosti pokrytí umožňují: znáhodněné konfidenční intervaly (známé už několik desetiletí) a relativní novinku, tzv. fuzzy konfidenční intervaly.","The present work follows up the ROBUST 2006 paper where various types of confidence intervals for binomial parameter p have been exposed. The coverage probability cannot equal the nominal confidence level 1-alpha in the whole domain [0, 1]. This leads to dilemmas (is the coverage of at least 1-alpha a must, or is it better to approximate 1-alpha from both sides?), and to multiplicity of proposals of confidence interval types. The present work extends the scope of the previous paper by such generalizations of ""ordinary"" confidence intervals that enable a constant coverage, namely by the randomized confidence intervals (introduced several decades ago), and by the relatively new idea of the fuzzy confidence intervals.","","BB","","UT ISI","ROBUST 2008.

First, the original problem is projected onto a lower dimensional subspace using the bidiagonalization algorithm, which by itself represents a form of regularization by projection. The projected problem, however, inherits a part of the ill-posedness of the original problem, and therefore some form of inner regularization must be applied. Stopping criteria for the whole process are then based on the regularization of the projected (small) problem. In this paper we consider an ill-posed problem with a noisy right-hand side (observation vector), where the noise level is unknown. We show how the information from the Golub-Kahan iterative bidiagonalization can be used for estimating the noise level. Such information can be useful for constructing efficient stopping criteria in solving ill-posed problems.","","Regularizační techniky založené na Golub-Kahanově iterační bidiagonalizaci náleží mezi populární přístupy k řešení rozsáhlých, špatně podmíněných úloh. Nejprve je původní problém projektován do prostoru nižší dimenze pomocí bidiagonalizačního algoritmu, ten sám o sobě realizuje regularizaci pomocí projekce. Projektovaný problém ovšem získá určité vlastnosti původního problému a tudíž je stále špatně podmíněný. Při jeho řešení tedy musí být využita nějaká další regularizační technika (vnitřní regularizace). Zastavení celého procesu je řízeno zastavovacím kritériem, které závisí na regularizovaném řešení projektovaného (malého) problému.

Golub, C.F. Van Loan (1980), and S. Van Huffel, J. Vandewalle (1991), and then complemented recently by the core problem approach of C.C. Paige, Z. Strakoš (2002, 2006).

Typical examples occur in natural gas and other energy consumption contexts. Due to various deficiencies of the original sample-only based model, due to possible inconsistencies between sample and the population as a whole, and/or due to inherently different nature of the available sample and population data, calibration arises as a natural way to improve original model. We start with a simple approach and proceed to introduce a formal and flexible, time-varying statistical model of state-space nature, from which such a calibration will come out as one of the products. The calibration model is quite general and hence it can be used far beyond the particular context of natural gas consumption modeling in which it was originally motivated.","","V tomto článku se zabýváme problémem vyskytujícím se v řadě oblastí, ve kterých je statistický model vyvinut a odhadnut na vzorku individuí (např. vzorku individuálně měřených trajektorií spotřeby zemního plynu) ale pak je aplikován na mnohem větší cílovou populaci. Kvůli různým chybám původního modelu vyvinutého na vzorku, ale i kvůli nekonzistencím mezi vzorkem a celkem a kvůli případným odlišnostem ve způsobu měření vzorku a celku je nutné původní model kalibrovat. Nejprve začneme s jednoduchou ad hoc regresní procedurou kterou potom formalizujeme (zohledníme přitom korektně různé, v jednoduchém přístupu zanedbávané zdroje rušivé variability). Výsledný semiparametrický statistický model využívá konzistentně veškeré dostupné informace a je založen na časově proměnlivé, lokálně lineární kalibraci. Je formulován jako dynamický model state-space typu. Ten pak dává kalibraci jako jeden z postranních produktů (kromě jiných odhadů s prakticky zajímavou interpretací).","JE","","cena09","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2009","2010","1","","","2-s2.0-70349612487","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0175304","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in its basic form, it is not suitable for use in problems which contain periodic attributes, such as oscillator phase, hour of day or directional heading. A commonly used technique of trigonometrically encoding periodic input attributes to artificially generate the required topology introduces a systematic error. In this paper, a metric which induces a conceptually correct topology for periodic attributes is embedded into the K-means algorithm. This requires solving a non-convex minimization problem in the maximization step. Results of numerical experiments comparing the proposed algorithm to K-means with trigonometric encoding on synthetically generated data are reported. The advantage of using the proposed K-means algorithm is also shown on a real example using gas load data to build simple predictive models.","","Algoritmus K-means je díky své jednoduchosti velmi populární v oblasti strojového učení. Ve své základní formě však není vhodný k použití v problémech s periodickými atributy, jakými jsou např. fáze oscilátoru, hodina dne, nebo azimut. Běžně používaná technika trigonometrického zakódování periodických atributů vytvářející deformovanou kruhovou topologii vnáší do řešení systematickou chybu. V této práci je do algoritmu K-means zapracována metrika, která indukuje kruhovou topologii bez deformací. Použití této metriky vyžaduje vyřešení nekonvexního minimalizačního problému v kroku maximalizace algoritmu K-means. Dále jsou shrnuty numerické experimenty porovnávající shlukování pomocí trigonometrického kódování a pomocí navrhované modifikace K-means algoritmu. V závěru je popsána úloha shlukování dat odběru plynu a vytvoření jednoduchých prediktivních modelů, kde je patrné zlepšení přesnosti v důsledku použití nové modifikace algoritmu K-means.","BB","","cena09 kolize10 atestace2013ano","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2009","2010","3","10.1142/S0218001409007338","wos:000267117500003","2-s2.0-67650703129","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0174747","","0;1","","","","","","","","","",""

Instantaneous phases of the modes underwent synchronization analysis and their statistically significant phase coherence, beginning from 1950s, has been observed. Thus the statistical evidence for a coupling between solar/geomagnetic activity and climate variability has been obtained from continuous monthly data, independent of the season, however, confined to the temporal scale related to oscillatory periods about 7–8 yr.","","Oscilační módy s periodou kolem 7-8 let byly detekovány v měsíčních časových řadách slunečních skvrn, aa-indexu geomagnetické aktivity, indexu Severoatlantické oscilace a povrchových teplot vzduchu několika evropských stanic ze středních zeměpisných šířek.

The paper argues that deductive fuzzy logics can be interpreted in terms of resources as well, and that under most circumstances they actually capture resource-aware reasoning more accurately than linear logic. The resource-based interpretation then provides an alternative motivation for formal fuzzy logics, and gives an explanation of the meaning of their intermediary truth values that can be justified more easily than their traditional motivation based on partial truth.","","Girardova lineární logika je často interpretována jakožto logika prostředků a zdrojů, zatímco formální fuzzy logiky jsou obvykle chápány jako logiky částečné pravdivosti.

Neural  network based Boolean factor analysis is a suitable method  for a very large binary data sets mining including web. Two  types of neural networks based Boolean factor analyzers are  analyzed. One based on feed forward neural network and  second based on Hopfield-like recurrent neural network. We  show that both methods give good results when processed data  have a simple structure. But as the complexity of data structure  grows, method based on feed forward neural network loses  the ability to solve the Boolean factor analysis. In the method,  based on the Hopfield like recurrent neural network, this effect  is not observed.","","V tomto příspěvku jsou porovnány dvě nové neurosíťové metody, zaměřené na řešení problému optimální booleovské faktorizace binárních matic resp.

Jsou analyzovány dva neurosíťové metody. Jedna založený na dopředné neuronové sítí a druhá na Hopfieldově neuronové sítí. Ukazujeme, že obě metody dávají dobré výsledky při zpracování dat s jednoduchou strukturou, ale jak složitost datové struktury roste, metoda založená na dopředné neuronové síti, ztrácí schopnost řešit úlohu Booleovské faktorové analýzy. V naší metodě, založené na Hopfieldově rekurentní neuronové síti, tento jev pozorován nebyl. V tomto ohledu je tedy lepší, v porovnání s konkurencí.","BB","","UTISI  * ISBN  přímo na příspěvku je 978-1-4244-4615-5 *","NDT 2009. International Conference on Networked Digital Technologies /1./.

We suppose that people are characterized by their actions, for example the deputies are characterized by their voting habits. We are interested in binary data analysis (e.g. the result of voting is yes or not). The dataset consisting of the roll-call votes records in the Russian parliament in 2004 was analyzed. Methods of hierarchical and fuzzy clustering, and Boolean factor analysis are applied. In the first case, we propose two-step analysis in which factor loadings (as result of factor analysis of objects) obtained in the first step are interpreted by cluster analysis in the second step. For the cluster number determination both traditional and modified coefficients are used. Further, we suggest using Hopfield-like neural network based Boolean factor analysis for this purpose. This proposed method gives the best results in the case of deputies grouping.","","Jsou porovnány některé významné metody pro identifikaci skupin objektů aplikovatelné na sociální skupiny.

By means of notions and techniques from Abstract Algebraic Logic, we perform a study of non-classical logics based on the kind of generalized implication connectives they possess. It yields the new hierarchy of implicational logics. In this framework the notion of implicational semilinear logic can be naturally introduced as a property of the implication, namely a logic L is an implicational semilinear logic iff it has an implication such that L is complete w.r.t. the matrices where the implication induces a linear order, a property which is typically satisfied by well-known systems of fuzzy logic. The hierarchy of implicational logics is then restricted to the semilinear case obtaining a classification of implicational semilinear logics that encompasses almost all the known examples of fuzzy logics and suggests new directions for research in the field.","","Článek prezentuje abstraktní rámec pro stále rostoucí třídu fuzzy logik. S použitím pojmů a technik Abstraktní Algebraické Logiky klasifikujeme neklasické logiky na základě zobecněných implikací v nich definovatelných. V tomto rámci jsou semilineární logiky přirozeně definovány pomocí vlastností implikace: logika L je semilineární pokud má implikaci, takovou že L je úplná vůči logickým maticím v nichž ona implikace indukuje lineární uspořádání (tuto vlastnost typické fuzzy logiky splňují). Hierarchie implikačních logik je poté zúžena na semlineární logiky. Vzniklá hierarchie klasifikuje většinu známých fuzzy logik a poskytuje nové směry rozvoje oboru.","BA","","UTISI","IFSA - EUSFLAT 2009.

We find that the shorter the population in 1890, the faster its height grew thereafter. Hence, there was convergence in physical stature between the peripheral areas of the monarchy and its core. The difference in trends between the trend in height in the Polish District of Przemysl and in Vienna was about 0.9 cm per decade, in favor of the former. Convergence among the core Districts themselves was minimal or non-existent, whereas the convergence among the peripheral Districts was more pronounced. Spatial convergence also took place between the peripheral regions and the more developed ones. The pattern is somewhat reminiscent of modern findings on convergence clubs in the global economy.","","V tomto článku sledujeme vývoj tělesné výšky (jakožto indikátoru biologické kvality života) v  Rakousko-Uherské monarchii.

Po zohlednění intervalového cenzorování (indukovaného způsobem záznamu historických dat) se ukazuje, ze sekulární trend výšky není ani zdaleka prostorově homogenní. Distrikty s menší počáteční výškou vykazují rychlejší sekulární trend. V důsledku tohoto samoregulaci připomínajícího mechanismu docházelo ve sledovaném období k homogenizaci  (konvergenci) dospělých vysek mezi okrajovými částmi a centrem monarchie.

Typical examples occur in natural gas and other energy consumption contexts. Due to various deficiencies of the original sample-only based model, due to possible inconsistencies between sample and the population as a whole, and/or due to inherently different nature of the available sample and populational data (their measurement, error properties, etc.), calibration arises as a natural way to improve original model. We will introduce a formal and flexible, time-varying statistical model of state-space nature, from which such a calibration will come out as one of the products.","","V tomto článku diskutujeme problém vyskytující se v situacích kdy je statistický model (např. trajektorií spotřeby) odvozen na vzorku individuí a po té masově aplikován na podstatně větší populaci, která je předmětem zájmu. Typickou ukázkou je modelování spotřeby zemního plynu. Díky různým deficiencím v původního modelu založeného jen na výběrovém vzorku, ale také díky odlišnostem v povaze výběrových a populačních dat (např. odlišně konstruované funkcionály, různé vlastnosti měřicích chyb apod.) je třeba původní model kalibrovat. Zde zformulujeme statistický model state-space typu který umožní plně formalizovanou časově-proměnlivou, lokálně lineární kalibraci jako jeden z důsledků.","JE","","","AEBD '09.

Nanomachines are modeled by a variant of finite-state automata - so-called timed probabilistic automata - augmented by a severely restricted communication mechanism capturing the main features of molecular communication. We show that for molecular communication among such motile machines an asynchronous stochastic protocol originally designed for wireless (radio) communication in so-called amorphous computers with static computational units can also be used. We design an algorithm that using the previous protocol, randomness and timing delays selects with a high probability a leader from among sets of anonymous candidates. This enables a probabilistic simulation of one of the simplest known model of a programmable computer - so-called counter automaton - proving that networks of mobile nanomachines possess universal computing power.","","Je navržen výpočetní model molekulárně komunikujících mobilních nano-mašin.

In order to perform efficient inference, graphical transformations of these networks are performed. The complexity of inference is proportional to the total table size of tables corresponding to the cliques of the triangulated graph. Therefore in order to get efficient inference it is desirable to have small cliques in the triangulated graph. We analyze existing heuristic triangulation methods applicable to BN2O networks after transformations using parent divorcing and tensor rank-one decomposition and suggest several modifications.

Then, the possibility to exploit this influence in order to improve the approximation capability of multilayer perceptrons by means of cross-validation and boosting is explained. Although in theory, the impact of both methods on the approximation capability of feed-forward networks is known, they are still not common in real-world applications.

However, most of the commonly used aggregation methods are static, i.e., they do not adapt to the currently classified pattern. In this paper, we provide a general framework for dynamic classifier systems, which use dynamic confidence measures to adapt to a particular pattern. Our experiments with random forests on 5 artificial and 11 real-world benchmark datasets show that dynamic classifier systems can significantly outperform both confidence-free and static classifier systems.","","Spojování klasifikátorů je populární metoda pro zvýšení kvality klasifikace - místo jednoho klasifikátoru je vytvořen systém klasifikátorů a výstupy těchto klasifikátorů jsou agregovány do finální predikce.

While traditional fuzzy logic admits various interpretations of membership degrees, deductive fuzzy logic always interprets them as degrees of truth preserved under inference. The latter fact imposes several constraints on systems of deductive fuzzy logic, which need not be followed by mainstream fuzzy logic. That makes deductive fuzzy logic a specific area of research that can be characterized both methodologically (by constraints on meaningful definitions) and formally (as a specific class of logical systems). An analysis of the relationship between deductive and traditional fuzzy logic is offered.","","Metodologické rozdíly mezi tradiční a deduktivní fuzzy logikou jsou v článku demonstrovány na třech případových studiích týkajících se pojmů Duboisových-Pradových graduálních prvků, entropie fuzzy množiny a agregačních operátorů. Na rozdíl od tradiční fuzzy logiky, která připouští rozmanité interpretace stupňů příslušnosti, deduktivní fuzzy logika je interpretuje zásadně jako stupně pravdivosti zachovávané inferencí. To podřizuje systémy deduktivní fuzzy logiky určitým omezením, kterými tradiční fuzzy logika není vázána. Deduktivní fuzzy logika je proto jejím specifickým podoborem, který lze charakterizovat metodologicky (omezeními kladenými na smysluplné definice) i formálně (jakožto určitou třídu logických systémů).

We focus on the problem of process mediation of semantically annotated process models of the service requester and provider. We propose an Abstract Process Mediation Framework identifying the key functional areas that need to be addressed by process mediation components. We present algorithms for solving the process mediation problem in two scenarios: (1) when the mediation process has complete visibility of the process model of the service provider and requester and (2) when the mediation process has visibility only of the process model of the provider, but not the requester (asymmetric scenario). The algorithms combine planning and semantic reasoning with the discovery of external services such as data mediators. The Process Mediation Agent is introduced, which realises an execution infrastructure for runtime mediation.","","Schopnost řešit problém nekompatibilit mezi poskytovatelem webových služeb a klientem je kritickým faktorem pro dosažení interoperability v dynamických prostředích.

Fourteen patients (73.6 ± 7.6 years) with AV block and implanted pacemakers were paced at a frequency of 100 bpm with various pacing voltages. A signal averaged QRS vector length was calculated at each degree of pacing voltage. The changes in the QRS complex duration were measured as a relative shift of the terminal region of the vectorcardiographic QRS complex (end-shift) and its most prominent peak (peak-shift) using the cross-correlation method. The nonlinear relationship between stimulation voltage and QRS duration was observed with the highest impact of stimulation voltage changes near the threshold value. The fourfold increase in the stimulation voltage above the threshold caused QRS complex shortening by 3.7 ± 2.1 ms (range 0.19 – 7.76 ms)","","Cílem této studie byla charakterizace vztahu mezi ventrikulárním budícím napětím kardiostimulátoru a délkou QRS komplexu.

Moreover, we concentrate on five kinds of distinguished semantics for these logics, study their relationships, characterization and we survey the known completeness methods and results for prominent logics. Finally, all completeness properties and distinguished semantics are also considered for the first-order versions of the logics where a number of new results are proved.","","Článek je příspěvkem k algebraickému studiu t-normových fuzzy logik.

It sketches the typology of rules extraction methods and of their rulesets, and recalls that quality measures for whole sets of rules have been so far used only in the case of classification rulesets. Then three particular approaches to extending ruleset quality measures from classification to general rulesets are discussed. The paper also recalls the possibility to measure the dependence of classification rulesets on parameters of the classification method by means of ROC curves, and proposes a generalization of ROC curves to general rulesets. Finally, the approach is illustrated on rulesets extracted with four important rules extraction methods from the well-known iris data.","","Článek se zabývá mírami kvality celých množin pravidel získávaných z dat, jako protikladem k obecněji užívaným mírám jednotlivých pravidel.

The method is a bit less efficient than the standard maximum likelihood method, however it is more robust. Simulation study emphasize the fact that crucial role is played by level of contamination. In cases of very small contamination, both methods give similar results. The larger contamination, the better are the t-moment estimates.

We introduce four measures of local classification confidence and study their suitability for classifier aggregation. We develop two novel classifier aggregation methods which utilize local classification confidence and we compare them to two commonly used methods for classifier aggregation. The results on four artificial and five real-world benchmark datasets show that by incorporating local classification confidence into classifier aggregation methods, significant improvement in classification quality can be obtained.","","Agregace klasifikátorů je metoda pro zvýšení kvality klasifikace.

This contribution is focused on the logical describing of watermarking method. In this paper basic analysis for the process of watermark implementation is presented. Comparing of two digital watermarking methods, both based on discrete orthogonal transforms, is described. In generally, discrete orthogonal transforms (mainly DCT) is a base for loss image compression. All information, which may be lost during lossy compression, is possible to leave in the image and these information may be modified during watermark embedding. Thus, a question is satisfying of remaining watermark requirements.","","Článek prezentuje některé vlastnosti digitálního vodotisku digitálních obrazů založeného na diskrétních ortogonálních transformacích (DCT - diskrétní kosinová transformace a KLT - Karhunenova-Loeveova transformace).

The aim was to analyze age, period and cohort specific CHD mortality in men from the Czech Republic. National data on mortality of men (30-74 yrs.) in the Czech Republic in 1980-2004 were explored. Poisson regression model was applied to evaluate age, period and cohort effects on mortality. An adequate fit of CHD men's mortality provided the age-period-cohort model (p=0.121). Fatal CHD risk in Czech men was significantly depended on age (the risk increasing with age), calendar period (the risk reduced in the recent years), and birth cohort (the risk decreasing with birth cohort). The crucial positive change in the CHD mortality trend was observed after the collapse of communism in 1989, and in men past age 40 years.","","Česká republika patří mezi země s vysokou úmrtnostní na ischemickou chorobu srdeční (ICHS).

Standardized load profile curves give a typical natural gas consumption pattern throughout a year in various time resolutions. Our semiparametric regression model uses three types of information, constant characteristics of an individual customer, individual historical consumption and time varying explanatory variables, both to describe typical trend and to correct for departure of current conditions from normal. The model's multiplicative structure allows for convenient separation of individual-specific and common time varying parts. Although corrections are parametric, no substantial information about the typical consumption trend is available, so it is modelled non-parametrically. Corrections for temperature effects are non-linear; hence we deal with them through an obvious extension of the generalized additive model framework.","","V článku je prezentován statistický model pro konstrukci typových diagramů denní dodávky zemního plynu (TDD).

Multiplikativní struktura modelu dovoluje separaci individuálních (konstantních) a společných (časově proměnlivých) členů. Zatímco korekce na odchylky od normálu lze rozumně modelovat parametricky, typický průběh je komplikovaný a jeho tvar není a priori znám. Proto je modelován neparametricky.

It is a part of a broader project aimed at prevention of damage caused by drivers' microsleeps. Random Forests (RF) method was chosen, on account of previous experience, as a base classification tool for the classification tasks studied. It is, however, not only routinely used: Various classification models tailored for a specific individual are constructed by combining a RF model derived from the individual's data with a model based on the data of the other suitably selected individuals. Several model combining strategies are described and results of their application on real-life EEG data in an extensive computational experiment are reported.","","Článek se zabývá vývojem klasifikačních modelů schopných rozlišit na základě elektroencefalografických (EEG) dat somnolenci (ospalost) od jiných stavů mozku, které se typicky vyskytují při řízení automobilu.

However, the execution environment reflecting a complex component model and its changes at runtime is a non-trivial and error-prone application. Hence it is beneficial to simplify and conceptualize the execution environment by having a simple way of describing component compositions and reconfigurations. In this paper we propose a minimalistic language which describes the composition of the component-based system’s infrastructure in a procedural way and thus reduces the execution environment basically to a simple language interpreter.","","Komponentový systém kromě modelu sestává i z exekučního prostředí, jež má za úkol instanciovat komponenty popsané modelem.

Component applications often involve complex interaction patterns such as callbacks and autonomous activities that can be properly modeled only by a formalism that (i) supports independent atomic events for method invocation and return from a method and (ii) allows to specify interleaving of events on component's provided and required interfaces. This paper attempts to answer the question whether a model involving only events on provided interfaces (calling protocol) could be valid under certain constraints on component behavior. The key contribution are the constraints on interleaving of events related to callbacks and autonomous activities, which are expressed via syntactical patterns, and evaluation of the proposed constraints on real-life component applications.","","Populární přístup ke kompoziční verifikaci komponentových aplikací je založen na principu assume-guarantee (předpoklad-záruka), kde předpoklad modeluje chování prostředí pro každou komponentu. Realistické komponentové aplikace často zahrnují složité vzory komunikace jako callbacky a autonomní aktivity, které mohou být přesně modelovány pouze formalismem, který (i) podporuje nezávislé atomické události pro volání metod a návraty z metod a (ii) dovoluje specifikaci explicitních proložení událostí na poskytovaných a požadovaných rozhraních komponenty. Tento článek se pokouší zodpovědět otázku, zda  model zahrnující pouze události na poskytovaných rozhraních (volací protokol) může být korektní při nějakých omezeních na chování komponent. Hlavním přínosem jsou omezení na proložení událostí vztažených ke callbackům a autonomním aktivitám, které jsou vyjádřeny pomocí syntaktických vzorů, a zhodnocení navržených omezení na realistických komponentových aplikacích.","JC","","","TOOLS EUROPE 2008.

In modern component systems, the  communication paths among components are realized by software connectors, which allow explicit modeling of the communication and ease its implementation, especially due to possibility of automatic connector  generation. However, connector generation is a complex task mainly due to wide semantic gap between the abstract specification of a connector at design time and its implementation. In this paper, we present an approach to generating implementations of software connectors. The approach is based on a new domain specific language for describing templates of connector implementations and a transformation framework using the Stratego/XT term rewriting system for generating source code of connectors.","","Komponentově orientované softwarové inženýrství představuje zavedené paradigma, jehož podstatou je model aplikace sestávající z mnoha komponent, které  obsahují pouze aplikační logiku a komunikují pouze prostřednictvím dobře definovaných rozhraní. V moderních komponentových systémech jsou komunikační cesty mezi komponentami realizovány pomocí konektorů, které umožňují modelování komunikace odděleně od aplikační logiky a zjednodušují implementaci komunikačních cest, především díky možnosti automatického generování implementačního kódu konektorů. To samo o sobě představuje netriviální úlohu, především z důvodu široké sémantické mezery mezi abstraktní specifikací konektoru ve fázi návrhu a jeho spustitelnou implementací. V článku představujeme přístup k řešení tohoto problému založený na využití doménového jazyka pro popis šablon implementací konektorů a jejich následné transformace na zdrojový kód s využitím transformačního frameworku Stratego/XT.","JC","","kolize09 grant  ITEA/EUREKA(EU) OSIRIS S!2023","ICCBSS 2008.

In SPL, software components play an important role. In this paper, we show how the original idea of component mode can be captured and further developed in behavior specification via the formalism of Extended Behavior Protocols (EBP). Moreover, we demonstrate how the modes in behavior specification can be used for modeling behavior of an entire product line. The main benefits include (i) the existence of a single behavior specification capturing the behavior of all product variants, and (ii) automatic verification of absence of communication errors among the cooperating components taking the variability into account. These benefits are demonstrated on a part of a non-trivial case study.","","Koncept software product lines (SPL) je moderní přístup k vývoji software, který zjednodušuje tvorbu příbuzných variant jednoho produktu.

An important issue here is how to verify an open model representing an isolated software component (also referred  as the missing environment problem in).  In this paper, we propose on-the-fly simulation of the component environment to address the issue. We employ behavior protocols and  a system coordinating two model checkers: Java PathFinder and BPChecker. This approach allows us to enclose the model representing the behavior of a given component and consequently to exhaustively  verify the model. Our solution was implemented as the Carmen tool.

Unlike stateless services, a stateful web service imposes constraints on the order in which the operations of the service may be invoked. However, specification of such constraints is not a standard part of a web service interface, and compliance with such constraints is not checked by the standard web service development tools. In this paper, we propose an extension to a web service interface consisting of a constraint definition based on behavior protocols. We also describe a tool that checks whether a given BPEL code complies with the constraints of all stateful web services it communicates with. The key idea behind the tool is to translate the BPEL code into Java and then to check the Java program using Java PathFinder with behavior protocol extension.","","Přestože webové služby jsou obecně viděny jako bezstavové, některé z nich jsou implicitně stavové. Důvodem jě to, že webové služby často pracují jako front-end k podnikovým systémům a jsou používány jejich klienty relačním způsobem. Narozdíl od bezstavových služeb, pro stavovou službu existují omezení na pořadí, ve kterém operace dané služby mohou být volány. Nicméně, specifikace takových omezení není standardní součástí rozhraní webové služby, a korespondence s těmi omezeními není ověřována běžnými nástroji pro vývoj webových služeb. V tomto článku navrhujeme rozšířit rozhraní webových služeb pomocí definice omezení, která je založena na protokolech chování. Dále jsme implementovali nástroj pro ověřování, jestli BPEL kód splňuje omezení všech stavových webových služeb, se kterými komunikuje.

These methods use besides a standard logarithmic barrier function also barrier functions bounded from below which have more favourable properties for investigation of global convergence. It deals with descent direction methods, where an approxmation of the Hessian matrix is computed by gradient differences or quasi-Newton updates. Two-level optimization is used. A direction vector is computed by a Choleski decompostition of a sparse matrix. Numerical experiments concerning two basic applications, minimization of a point maximum and a sum of absolute values of smooth functions, are presented.","","Je popsána nová třída primárních metod vnitřních bodů pro zobecněnou minimaxovou optimalizaci. Tyto metody používají kromě standardní logaritmické barierové funkce též zdola omezené barierové funkce, které mají příznivější vlastnosti pro vyšetřování globální konvergence. Jde o metody spádových směrů, kde se aproximace Hessovy matice počítá buď pomocí diferencí gradientů nebo pomocí kvazinewtonovských aktualizací. Používá se dvojúrovňová optimalizace. Směrový vektor se počítá pomocí Choleského rozkladu řídké matice.

In the composition, it is assumed that primitive services are known to the composition component in advance. At the same time, in matchmaking algorithms, usually only one service is considered as a suitable  candidate satisfying a query while service combinations are not allowed. The problem is that in realistic composition or mediation scenarios in dynamic environments some specific  gap can be bridged only by using a combination of several services which are not known and need to be discovered.  We consider such a situation and we propose an approach using a combined match and a composed match. We give a characterization of these two matching types and we develop appropriate matching algorithms.","","Problémy kompozice webových služeb a jejich objevování jsou ve většině současných výzkumných prací řešeny odděleně. U kompozice se předpokládá, že primitivní služby jsou známy a že je komponenta realizující kompozici nemusí vyhledávat. Na stranu druhou algoritmy pro vyhledávání služeb obvykle předpokládají, že jako vhodní kandidáti vyhovující vyhledávacímu dotazu mohou být nalezeny pouze individuální služby, zatímco kombinace několika služeb obvykle nebývají povoleny. V reálných situacích (např. kompozice či procesní mediace) v otevřených prostředích je však často možné specifický vyhledávací požadavek uspokojit jen za použití kombinace několika služeb. V tomto článku adresujeme právě takové situace a navrhujeme tzv. kombinované vyhledávání a komponované vyhledávání umožňující vyhledávání skupin služeb uspokojujících daný vyhledávací požadavek.

Vzhledem k tomu, že naprostá většina faktorů je preventabilních, měly by výsledky sloužit k co nejúčinnějšímu využití v primární i sekundární prevenci kardiovaskulárních onemocnění jako je ischemická choroba srdeční.","A study sponsored by the European Centre for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology – Cardio and the Centre of Biomedical Informatics at the Czech Academy of Sciences followed up a total of 54 men and 15 women, aged 40 and older, who were recommended for percutaneous coronary intervention with coronary stent implantation. Anthropometric and clinical parameters were analyzed as well as traditional risk factors like age, gender, family history, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking status, overweight and diabetes. Statistic analyses showed significant relationship between phenotype, main lifestyle risk factors and increased risk of ischemic heart disease. These results should be used for the prevention of cardiovascular deseases such as ischemic heart disease.","","AC","","cena09","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2008","2009","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0165816","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research has been motivated by increasingly frequent extraction of non-classification rules, such as association rules and rules of observational logic, in real-world data mining tasks. The paper sketches the typology of rules extraction methods and of their rulesets, and recalls that quality measures for whole sets of rules have been so far used only in the case of classification rulesets. It then proposes three possible ways how such measures can be extended to general rulesets. The paper also recalls the possibility to measure the dependence of classification ruleset on parameters of the classification method by means of ROC curves, and proposes a generalization of ROC curves to general rulesets. Finally, a brief illustration on rulesets extracted by means of the method GUHA is given.","","Článek se zabývá mírami kvality celých souborů pravidel získávaných z dat, jako protikladem k běžněji používaným mírám jednotlivých pravidel.

One of the most useful types of such reduction is the orthogonal reduction to (upper) Hessenberg form. This reduction can be computed by the Arnoldi algorithm. When A is Hermitian, the resulting upper Hessenberg matrix is tridiagonal.

For the sources might provide data of a different quality, a novel reputation system is proposed specially for the distributed source environment handling differences in the quality of the sources. The quality of the sources is affected by many components that are combined into a measure influencing the reputation of sources. The global repository is designed not only to passively collect data, but also to provide valuable feedback to the sources. The formalism used for description of the global repository is a generalization of the binary matrix formalism, which is narrowly connected with the ideas of the Semantic Web.","","Článek přináší popis globálního virtuálního depozitáře vytvořeného z webových zdrojů za použití dostupných technologií (sémantického) webu.

These mutations result in decreased or structurally poor production of collagen. Severity of OI depends on type and placing mutation in gene of collagen type I.

There are several well known methods and algorithms for factorization of real data but many application areas including information retrieval, pattern recognition and data mining often require processing of binary rather than real data. Unfortunately, the methods used for real matrix factorization fail in the latter case. In this paper we focus on the Boolean Matrix Factorization (BMF), introduce the task and present neural network, genetic algorithm and nonnegative matrix factorization based BMF solvers. The algorithms are tested on several data sets and their results are compared.","","Rozklad matic respektive faktorová analýza je důležitá úloha v oblasti analýzy dat s vysokou dimenzí. Ve známost již vešlo mnoho metod a algoritmů pro data tvořená reálnými čísly, ale v mnoha aplikačních oblastech, např v oblasti dokumentografických systémů (IR), rozpoznávání vzorů (pattern recognition) a vytěžování dat (data mining), vzniká požadavek na analýzu binárních dat, kdy metody používané pro rozklad reálných matic jsou zcela nepoužitelné. V tomto příspěvku se zaměřujeme na Booleovskou faktorovou analýzu, která tento problém řeší. Přinášíme jak definici samotné jak samotné úlohy, tak řešící algoritmus založený ne neuronové síti a také metodu založenou na NMF.

Unlike traditional group averaging approaches, we are faced with the irregularities of individual consumption series posed by inter-individual heterogeneity, including zeros, missing data, and abrupt consumption pattern changes. Our model is of the nonlinear regression type, with individual customer-specific parameters that, nevertheless, have a common distribution corresponding to the nonlinear mixed effects model framework. It is advantageous to build the model conditionally. The first condition, whether a particular customer has consumed or not, is modeled as a consumption status in an individual fashion. The prediction performance of the proposed model is demonstrated using a real dataset of 62 individual customers, and compared with two more traditional approaches: ARIMAX and ARX","","V článku se popisuje model pro předpověď denních hodnot spotřeby zemního plynu individuálních zákazníků.

Over the last decade, a considerable amount of new information has emerged describing the protein components of microfibrils. Fibrillin associating microfibrils appear to fulfil several physiological roles, including acting as scaffolding for tropoelastin deposition and elastic fibre formation during elastogenesis, contributing to the elastic properties of the elastic fibres, and maintaining tissue homeostasis (36). Their physiological importance is underscored by the complex spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with mutations in genes encoding microfibrils.

But rule-based knowledge representations alone cannot be used for the natural flow of speech. In this paper, optimisation of the naturalness of speech, i.e. the optimal choice of phonetic and phonologic parameters for prosody modelling is sought. We will try to find relevant features (speech parameters) having the basic influence on the fundamental frequency and duration of speech units. If the prosody of the synthesizer is controlled by an artificial neural network (ANN), optimisation of the ANN topology is necessary. The topology of the ANN is also dependent on the number of input neurons which represent the most important speech parameters. The pruning of the ANN based on the several approaches (GUHA method, sensitivities of the synaptic weights, etc.) is a suitable tool for reducing the ANN structure.","","Každý jazyk lze popsat gramatickými pravidly, ale ta sama nestačí pro přirozené znění výstupu hlasového syntezátoru.

There are several well known methods and algorithms for factorization of real data but many application areas including information retrieval, pattern recognition and data mining require processing of binary rather than real data. Unfortunately, the methods used for real matrix factorization fail in the latter case. In this paper we introduce the background of the task as well as genetic algorithm based solver and present results obtained from computer experiments.","","Maticová faktorizace neboli faktorová analýza je důležitá metoda užitečná pro analýzu vysoce dimenzionálních dat reálného světa. Pro faktorizaci reálných dat existuje několik známých metod a algoritmů, ale v mnoha aplikacích včetně vyhledávání informací, rozpoznávání obrazů a data mining se vyžaduje spíše zpracování binárních než reálných dat.

The idea of model reduction via matching moments is well known and widely used in approximation of dynamical systems, but it goes back to Stieltjes, with some preceding work done by Chebyshev and Heine. The algebraic moment matching problem can for A hermitian positive definite be formulated as a variant of the Stieltjes moment problem, and can be solved using Gauss-Christoffel quadrature. Using the operator moment problem suggested by Vorobyev, we will generalize model reduction based on matching moments to the non-Hermitian case in a straightforward way. Unlike in the model reduction literature, the presented proofs follow directly from the construction of the Vorobyev moment problem.","","V článku uvažujeme obecný matematický koncept redukce modelu při zachování maximálního počtu momentů. Tato myšlenka je dobře známa a široce užívána v aproximaci dynamických systémů. Lze ji však nalézt už u Stiltjese, s ještě staršími výsledky dosaženými Čebyševem a Heinem. Algebraický problém redukce modelu při zachování maximálního počtu momentů může být pro hermitovskou pozitivně definitní matici formulován jako varianta Stiltješsova problému momentů, a může být vyřešen prostřednictvím Gauss-Christofellovy kvadratury. S použitím operátorového problému momentů navrženého Vorobjevem zobecníme redukci modelu z hermitovského případu na případ obecný. Na rozdíl od známé literatury o redukci modelu vyplývají námi uvedené důkazy přímo z konstrukce Vorobjevova problému momentů.","BA","","cena08","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2009","2009","2","10.1007/s11075-008-9237-0","wos:000266093300005","2-s2.0-67349146721","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0163535","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cílem výzkumu je identifikovat malou podmnožinu těchto elektrod, která je nejvíce relevantní k detekci jednotlivých úrovní pozornosti řidiče. Zejména se zaměřujeme na detekci nebezpečného stavu mikrospánku. Výběr mezi elektrodami byl proveden v kombinaci užití metody vytěžování z dat GUHA a C4.5 klasifikačního algoritmu.","IN","","do RIVu hlášeno kvůli MDS též pod sysno 0341912 (smazán)","ECC'08.

The architecture of amorphous computers is random, since they consist of a plethora of identical computational units spread randomly over a given area. Within a limited radius the units can communicate wirelessly with their neighbors via a single-channel radio. We consider a model whose assumptions on the underlying computing and communication abilities are among the weakest possible: all computational units are finite state probabilistic automata working asynchronously, there is no broadcasting collision detection mechanism and no network addresses. We show that under reasonable probabilistic assumptions such amorphous computing systems can possess universal computing power with a high probability.","","Amorfní počítání se liší od klasických představ o výpočtech téměř ve všech ohledech. Architektura amorfních počítačů je náhodná, protože tyto se skládají z množství identických procesorů náhodně rozhozených v dané oblasti. Procesory mohou bezdrátově komunikovat pouze se svými blízkými použitím jedno-kanálového rádia. Budeme uvažovat model, jehož předpoklady jsou jedny z nejslabších možných: procesory jsou tvořeny asynchronními konečně-stavovými pravděpodobnostními automaty. Neexistují síťové adresy procesorů ani mechanismy pro detekci vysílacích kolizí.

That is, the algorithm computes a factorization PAPT = LTLT, where, P is a permutation matrix, L is lower triangular with a unit diagonal and entries’ magnitudes bounded by 1, and T is symmetric and tridiagonal. The algorithm is based on the basic (nonpartitioned) methods of Parlett and Reid and of Aasen.

Our implementation also computes the QR factorization of T and solves linear systems of equations using the computed factorization. The partitioning allows our algorithm to exploit modern computer architectures (in particular, cache memories and high-performance blas libraries). Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms achieve approximately the same level of performance as the partitioned Bunch-Kaufman factor and solve routines in  lapack.","","","BA","","hodui2015 rozložník","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2011","2012","4","10.1145/1916461.1916462","wos:000287849900001","2-s2.0-79952496435","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0162634","","0;1","","","","","","","","","",""

Two main approaches are compared: the one that computes the approximate solution in terms of a Krylov space basis from an upper triangular linear system for the coordinates, and the one where the approximate solutions are updated with a simple recursion formula. We show that a different choice of the basis can significantly influence the numerical behavior of the resulting implementation. While Simpler GMRES and ORTHODIR are less stable due to the ill-conditioning of the basis used, the residual basis is well-conditioned as long as we have a reasonable residual norm decrease. These results lead to a new implementation, which is conditionally backward stable, and they explain the experimentally observed fact that the GCR method delivers very accurate approximate solutions when it converges fast enough without stagnation.","","V této práci analyzujeme numerické chování několika metod minimalizujících normu rezidua, které jsou matematicky ekvivalentní metodě GMRES. Porovnáváme dva základní postupy: postup, který je založen na výpočtu aproximace řešení z horní trojúhelníkové soustavy pro její souřadnice a postup, kde jsou aproximace postupně upravovány jednoduchou rekurzní formulí. Práce ukazuje, že volba báze vypočteného prostoru může podstatným způsoben ovlivnit numerickou stabilitu implementace daných metod. Z důvodu špatné podmíněnosti zvolené báze jsou implementace Simpler GMRES a ORTHODIR méně stabilní. Na druhé straně se ukazuje, ze pokud metoda konverguje dostatečně rychle, je báze reziduí dobře podmíněná. Tyto výsledky pak vedou k nove implementaci, která je podmíněně zpětně stabilní, a potvrzují experimentálně známý fakt, že metoda GCR v případě dostatečně rychlé konvergence generuje velice přesné aproximace řešení.","BA","","cena09","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2008","2010","5","10.1137/070707373","wos:000263103700013","2-s2.0-70449371819","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0162481","","1","","","","","","","","","",""

This is a novel approach, since usually pseudo-random number generators are evaluated using tests specifically designed for this purpose. Such specific tests are more sensitive. Hence, detecting the dependence using machine-learning methods implies that the dependence is indeed very strong. The most important example of a generator, where dependencies may easily be found using our approach, is MATLAB’s function rand if the method state is used. This method was the default in MATLAB versions between 5 (1995) and 7.3 (2006b), i.e., for more than 10 years. In order to evaluate the strength of the dependence in it, we used the same machine-learning tools to detect dependencies in some other random number generators, which are known to be bad or insufficient for large simulations.","","Článek popisuje, jak mohou být v některých známých generátorech náhodných čísel detekovány závislosti pomocí obecných nástrojů strojového učení. Jde o nový přístup, protože pseudonáhodné generátory jsou obvykle posuzovány pomocí testů specificky určených pro tento účel. Tyto specifické testy jsou citlivější, proto možnost detekce závislostí pomocí metod strojového učení implikuje, že jde o velmi silné závislosti. Nejdůležitější příklad generátoru, ve kterém lze závislosti snadno najít pomocí našeho přístupu, je funkce rand v MATLAB, pokud je použita metoda state. Tato metoda byla výchozí metodou ve verzích MATLAB mezi 5 (1995) a 7.3 (2006b), tedy více než 10 let. Pro posouzení síly této závislosti jsme použili stejné nástroje strojového učení k detekci závislostí v dalších generátorech, o kterých je známo, že jsou špatné nebo nedostatečné pro rozsáhlejší simulace.","BA","","cena08","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2008","2009","1","10.1080/08839510701768382","wos:000254579900005","2-s2.0-42949118239","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0162468","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The structured health documentation in dentistry in the form of an EHR is being systematically studied. This paper describes the evolution of the EHR developed in the EuroMISE Center named MUDRLite and its graphical component for dentists called DentCross. The summary of features of the DentCross component is followed by a brief description of automatic speech recognition and an ASR module. The problems with data insertion into EHR during examination of a dental patient lead to further research in the area of the automatic speech recognition in medical practice. DentVoice is a successful application of the ASR module and the DentCross component of the MUDRLite EHR. Voice-controlled data entry makes hand-busy activities in dental practice more comfortable, which results in a better quality of the data stored in dental EHR, better decision making and use of decision support systems.","","EuroMISE centrum se zaměřuje na nové přístupy v oblasti elektronických zdravotních záznamů (EZZ). Významnou aplikační oblastí je oblast stomatologie, ve které byl implementován EZZ MUDRLite, vyvinutý v rámci EuroMISE centra včetně jeho specializované grafické komponenty pro stomatology – zubního kříže. Souhrn vlastností komponenty zubního kříže pokračuje stručným popisem techniky automatického rozpoznávání řeči (ARR) a vlastního modulu ARR. Problémy se zadáváním dat do EZZ během vyšetření stomatologického pacienta vedly k dalšímu výzkumu v oblasti uživatelského rozhraní systému a využití ARR v medicínské praxi. Výsledkem je DentVoice, jako úspěšná aplikace ARR modulu a komponenty zubního kříže EZZ MUDRLite. Hlasem ovládané zadávání dat zjednodušuje řadu aktivit ve stomatologické praxi, při kterých lékař nemá volné ruce.

Soubor pacientů a metody: Osmi pacientům s těžkým syndromem suchého oka bylo aplikováno AS-oční kapky po dobu 3 měsíců, a to úměrně počtu aplikací umělých slz, maximálně však 8krát denně. Klinické testy a laboratorní testy byly provedeny před a po ukončení aplikace AS-očních kapek. Během studie pacienti denně posuzovali subjektivní stav očí. Výsledky a závěr: Aplikace AS-očních kapek vedla ke statisticky významnému zlepšení hodnot Schirmerova testu, vyšetření detritu a keratitis punctata. Na povrchu spojivky došlo ke zvýšení počtu pohárkových buněk a ke snížení počtu buněk apoptotických. Ve všech pacienty hodnocených kategoriích stavu oka došlo k významnému snížení intenzity nepříjemných pocitů. Pozitivní působení AS-očních kapek při syndromu suchého oka je zřejmé a jeho aplikace má předpoklady stát se běžnou léčebnou praxí.","Aim: To detect the changes on the conjunctiva surface before and after the application of the autologous serum (AS) eye drops in patients with dry eye syndrome. Material and methods: The SA eye drops were applied during the period of 3 months in 8 patients with dry eye syndrome with the maximum frequency 8 times a day. The clinical and laboratory examinations were performed at the start and at the end of the 3 months treatment period. Each day, patients reported their ocular status. Results and conclusions: The AS eye drops application improved significantly the values of the Shirmer test, detritus and superficial punctate keratitis as well. The goblet cells density on the conjunctival surface increase and the number of apoptotic cells decreased. The intensity of unpleasant feelings reported by the patients decreased significantly in all of the assessed categories. The application of the AS eye drops application should become common therapeutic practice with dry eye syndrome.","","FF","","cena08 *** atestace2013ne","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2008","2008","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0159916","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The semantic content of developed EHRs was defined by the set of important medical concepts for the diagnosis of cardiological patients named the Minimal Data Model for Cardiological patients (MDMC). This model was a basis for a small EHR called ADAMEK, specially designed to collect data in the outpatients’ environment. MUDRLite was inspired by MUDR EHR and preserved the flexibility of stored data. The MUDRLite2 technology combines the experience of MUDRLite and advanced enterprise programming technologies. The pilot implementation of MUDRLite2 is the AdamekJ application, created as a data collection tool in the field of cardiology and genetics, replacing the ADAMEK EHR. Since all EHR systems are based either directly (ADAMEK, AdamekJ) or indirectly (MUDR, MUDRLite) on the MDMC, the semantic interoperability among them is guaranteed.","","Elektronický zdravotní záznam (EZZ) je v EuroMISE centru studován již dlouhou dobu, díky čemuž bylo vytvořeno široké spektrum systémů EZZ. Sémantický obsah vyvinutých EZZ byl definovaný množinou důležitých medicínských konceptů z oblasti diagnostiky kardiologických pacientů, která byla nazvána Minimální datový model kardiologického pacienta (MDMK). Tento model byl základem pro malý EZZ nazvaný ADAMEK, který byl speciálně vyvinut pro sběr dat v ambulantním prostředí. MUDRLite byl inspirovaný EZZ MUDR a zachoval jeho flexibilitu ukládání dat. Technologie MUDRLite2 kombinuje zkušenosti z tvorby MUDRLite a pokročilé enterprise programovací techniky. Pilotní implementací technologie MUDRLite2 je aplikace AdamekJ, vytvořená pro sběr dat v oblasti kardiologie a genetiky a nahrazuje EZZ ADAMEK. Jelikož všechny zmiňované EZZ jsou založeny buď přímo (ADAMEK, AdamekJ) a nebo nepřímo (MUDR, MUDRLite) na MDMK, je mezi nimi zaručená spolupráce na sémantické úrovni .","IN","","UT ISI","CeHR: International Conference 2007. eHealth: Combining Health Telematics, Telemedicine, Biomedical Engineering and Bioinformatics to the Edge.

We consider several different methods for estimating conditional mutual information. The behavior of each estimator with respect to its free parameter is shown using a linear model where an analytical estimate of conditional mutual information is available. Numerical experiments in detecting coupling directionality are performed using chaotic oscillators, where the influence of the phase extraction method and relative frequency ratio is investigated.","","Odhalení směrovosti vazby mezi systémy je důležitým krokem ve snaze porozumění chování složitých oscilačních systémů.

Priorita může následně být použita buďto návrhářem (člověkem) jako pomocný prvek pro přípravu návrhu, nebo při automatickém návrhu integračního procesu zahrnující pravidla s maximální prioritou. Studie v příspěvku se detailně věnuje dvěma základním typům pravidel, ekvivalenci a hierarchii, přičemž ohodnocení kandidátů je založeno na (strukturální) analýze aktivních domén atributů. V neposlední řadě příspěvek ukazuje možnost decentralizovaného přístupu k integraci dat, jenž je inspirován webovými technologiemi.","The paper is focused on accesses how  a nontrivial task of data integration rule finding can be automatized. It proposes to automatically genereate cadidates to rules together with an indirect measure evaluating a support of the rule in the knowledge base. This measure can be used as a priority of the candidates in order to sort the candidates for manual (human) tuninig. When a human activity is not possible, the rules with uniquely maximal support can be choosen as the best available approximation of the integration rules.The paper concerns two basic kinds of integration rules, equivalency and hierarchy, and selects a structural analysis of attribute domains for estimating a rule support. Moreover the paper brings a dencentralised access for data integration, which is inspired by web technologies.","","IN","","UT ISI","Znalosti 2008. Annual Conference /7./.

Also, data on their demographics and reperfusion strategy were collected. An assessed clinical outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results: The mean age of STEMI patients was 66.9 +/- 2.6 years. The vast majority were men (62.4%). A total of 68.6% STEMI patients received primary reperfusion treatment, 97.0% of them were referred for PPCI and 3.6% were treated with fibrinolytic therapy. Women and elderly patients were less likely to receive reperfusion therapy. The in-hospital mortality was 11.3% for all STEMI patients; 3.5% in reperfused and 25.7% in non-reperfused group (p < 0.001). When adjusting for age, the effect of reperfusion therapy remained significant. Conclusions: In-hospital mortality was significantly reduced in a subgroup of patients who underwent primary reperfusion treatment (PPCI or fibrinolytic therapy).","","Metoda: Do studie bylo zařazeno celkem 744 po sobě jdoucích pacientů se STEMI v letech 2003–2006. Byly shromážděny i jejich demografické údaje a informace o reperfuzí strategii. Hodnoceným klinickým parametrem byla nemocniční mortalita. Výsledky: Průměrný věk pacientů se STEMI byl 66,9 +/-12,6 let. V převážné většině se jednalo o muže (62,4 %). Primární reperfuzí léčba byla provedena celkem u 68,6 % pacientů se STEMI, 97,0 % jich bylo indikováno k provedení PPKI a 3,6 % jich bylo léčeno fibrinolýzou. U žen a starších nemocných existovala menší pravděpodobnost, že u nich bude provedena reperfuzní léčba. Nemocniční mortalita u všech pacientů se STEMI dosáhla 11,3 %; z toho 3,5 % ve skupině s reperfuzí a 25,7 % ve skupině bez reperfuze (p < 0,001). Po korekci na věk zůstal účinek repefuzní léčby statisticky významný.

The systems are solved by a preconditioned iterative method. We attempt to improve the overall solution process by sharing a part of the computational effort throughout the sequence. Our approach is fully algebraic and it is based on updating preconditioners by a block triangular update. A particular update is computed in a black-box fashion from the known preconditioner of some of the previous matrices, and from the difference of involved matrices. Results of our test compressible flow problems show, that the strategy speeds up the entire computation. The acceleration is particularly important in phases of instationary behavior where we saved about half of the computational time in the supersonic and moderate Mach number cases. In the low Mach number case the updated decompositions were similarly effective as the frozen preconditioners.","","Článek je praktickou ukázkou účinnosti aktualizace přepodmínění iteračních metod pro řešení sekvenci rozsáhlých a řídkých soustav lineárních algebraických rovnic.

The model problem discussed represents a simple hydro-mechanical model of the global project on a security of regions endangered by great hurricanes and deluges. The main goal of the idea of this project is to connect the climatic observations and the corresponding climatic models with the thermo-hydro-dynamic and the thermo-hydro-mechanic models, with the possibility to estimate future destructions of such endangered regions with landslides of unstable slopes. The investigated mathematical model is based on the visco-plastic Bingham rheology. The numerical approach is based on the semi-implicit scheme in time and the FE approximation in space.

This hard combinatorial optimization problem is reduced to the minimum energy problem in Hopfield nets by a linear-size construction. In particular, the classes of equivalent optimal stripifications are mapped one to one to the minimum energy states that are reached by a Hopfield network during sequential computation starting at the zero initial state. Thus the underlying Hopfield network powered by simulated annealing (i.e. Boltzmann machine) which is implemented in a program HTGEN can be used for computing the semi-optimal stripifications. Practical experiments confirm that one can obtain much better results using HTGEN than by a leading stripification program FTSG although the running time of simulated annealing grows rapidly near the global optimum. Nevertheless, HTGEN exhibits empirical linear ...","","Důležitá úloha generování minimálního počtu sekvenčních trojúhelníkových pásů (tristrips) pro daný triangulovaný povrchový model je motivována aplikacemi v počítačové grafice.

The aim of this paper is to discuss numerical behavior of several nonsymmetric iterative methods applied for solving the saddle point systems via the Schur complement reduction or the null-space projection approach. Krylov subspace methods often produce the iterates which fluctuate rather strongly. Here we address the question whether large intermediate approximate solutions reduce the final accuracy of these two-level (inner-outer) iteration algorithms. We extend our previous analysis obtained for symmetric saddle point problems and distinguish between three mathematically equivalent back-substitution schemes which lead to a different numerical behavior when applied in finite precision arithmetic. Theoretical results are then illustrated on a simple model example.","","Nesymetrické sedlobodové soustavy se vyskytují ve velkém množství aplikací výpočetní matematiky. Cílem této publikace je popsat numerické chování nesymetrických iteračních metod pro řešení sedlobodových soustav metodou redukce na Schurův doplněk nebo metodou projekce na nulový prostor mimodiagonálního bloku. Je známo, že Krylovovské metody v těchto případech často generují aproximace s vysoce oscilující normou. V této práci se věnujeme problému zda aproximace s velkou normou ovllivňují limitní přesnost těchto dvojúrovňových algoritmů. Tato práce je rozšířením analýzy pro symetrické sedlobodové úlohy a získané teoretické výsledky jsou ilustrovány na modelovém příkladě.","BA","","cena07","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2008","2008","","10.1016/j.cam.2007.03.021","wos:000254808700003","2-s2.0-39849085834","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0135991","","1","","","","","","","","","",""

Two main representatives of segregated solution approach are analyzed: the Schur complement reduction method based on the elimination of primary unknowns and the null-space projection method, which relies on a basis for the subspace described by the constraints. We show that the choice of the back-substitution formula may considerably influence the maximum attainable accuracy of approximate solutions computed in finite precision arithmetic.","","V této publikaci studujeme numerickou stabilitu iteračních Krylovovských metod pro řešení rozsáhlých sedlobodových soustav.
