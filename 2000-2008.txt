We developed the new recall procedure of Hoppfield-like associative memory which allows search all attractors corresponding to factors (a true attractor). Necessary separation of spurious attractors is based on calculation of their Lyapunov function. Being applied to textual data the procedure allows to reveal groups of highly correlated words (factors) which frequently occur in documents jointly and represent topics of that documents.","","Presentována je nová procedura vhodná pro booleovskou faktorovou analýzu signálu velké dimenze a složitosti založená na vyhledávání atraktorů v asociativní paměti Hopfieldova typu.

Rozlišení pravých a lživých atraktorů je založeno na srovnání hodnot jejich Lyapunových funkcí. Aplikaci tohoto booleovského faktorového analyzátoru na textová data umožnilo nalezení skupin silně korelovaných slov (faktorů), které se často objevují v textu dokumentu spolu a vypovídají tudíž o tématickému zaměření příslušných dokumentů.","BA","","","IEEE SITIS 2005.

A novel genetic learning algorithm for RBF networks and perceptrons with one hidden layer that operates only on these parametrizations has been proposed.

Implicative fuzzy systems are the systems with IF-THEN structure of their rules being represented by residuated implication. Radial fuzzy systems have their antecedents represented by radial functions. A fuzzy system has nominal consequents if the universe of discourse of consequent fuzzy sets is given by a finite, generally unordered, set. The question of coherence is the question of under which conditions the output of a fuzzy system is always defined (is non-empty) regardless of the actual input.

We formulate several guidelines based on H\\'ajek's methodology in fuzzy logic, which enable us to follow closely the constructions and methods of classical mathematics recast in a fuzzy setting. As a particular solution we propose a three-layer architecture of fuzzy mathematics, with the layers of formal fuzzy logic, a foundational theory, and individual mathematical disciplines developed within its framework. The ground level of logic being sufficiently advanced, we focus on the foundational level; the theory we propose for the foundations of fuzzy mathematics can be characterized as Henkin-style higher-order fuzzy logic. Finally we give some hints on the further development of individual mathematical disciplines in the proposed framework, and proclaim it a research programme in formal fuzzy mathematics.","","Článek konstatuje problém fragmentace soudobé fuzzy matematiky a potřebu jednotného formalismu a metodologického přístupu.

Konkrétně navrhneme troj-úrovňovou architekturu fuzzy matematiky (logika, základní teorie a v ní budované jednotlivé matematické disciplíny). Jelikož vrstva logická je již dostatečně propracována, zaměříme se na vytvoření základní teorie, k tomuto účelu navrhneme Henkinovskou fuzzy logiku vyššího řádu.

For large customers, consumption is measured daily or, at least, monthly. However, meter readings are taken and consequently billed in approximately 12-month intervals in small commercial and resident sectors. This period is too long with respect to the needs of gas companies. Furthermore, the companies have to estimate unbilled revenues at the end of an accounting period. Thus, there is a strong interest in mathematical modeling of the consumption  patterns as a basis of such estimates. This paper discusses requirements for unbilled revenues estimation, and summarizes experience with mathematical model GAMMA used by West Bohemian Gas Distribution Company in Pilsen, Czech Republic. In addition, plans for further development of model GAMMA are presented in connection with a research grant awarded by the Grant Agency of the Academy of Science of the Czech Republic.","","Pro obchodníky se zemním plynem i distribuční společnosti je klíčové porozumět chování svých zákazníku.

Pro maloodběratele a domácnosti se však odečet spotřeby a následné fakturování provádí pouze 1x za rok, což je příliš dlouhá doba neodpovídající potřebám společností. Mimoto musejí tyto společnosti na konci každého účetního období odhadovat nevyfakturované příjmy. Proto existuje silný zájem o model chování odběratelů, který by sloužil jako základ pro podobné odhady.

The model problem represents mathematical models of the Earth's mantle movements, of the volcanic zones, etc. Numerical approaches in the dynamic case, based on the semi-implicit scheme in time and a finite element approximation in the space, and in the stationary flow case, based on the penalization, regularization and finite element techniques and semi-implicit scheme in thermal part of  the problem, are shortly developed and discussed.","","Článek se zabývá řešitelností kontaktní úlohy s lokálním vazko-plastickým třením v termo-vazko-plastické Binghamově reologii. Je vyšetřován obecný případ těles libovolného tvaru, které jsou ve vzájemném kontaktu. Modelová úloha představuje matematické modely pohybů v zemském plášti, v oblastech vulkánů apod. Numerické řešení v dynamickém případě je založeno na semi-implicitním schématu v čase a metodě konečných prvků v prostoru, ve stacionárním případě pak na metodě penalizace, regularizace a metodě konečných prvků. Pro případ tepelné části úlohy je užito semi-implicitní schema v čase a metoda konečných prvků v prostoru.","BA","","cena06","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2006","2007","","10.1016/j.future.2005.04.010","wos:000234904100014","2-s2.0-29644445206","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0125757","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In work of Behounek and the present author, Henkin-style higher-order fuzzy logic is introduced and proposed as a foundational theory for fuzzy mathematics. Here we investigate the properties of fuzzy partitions within its formal framework. We follow closely the methodology of the above-mentioned approach. Therefore the notions introduced here are inspired by (and deduced from) the corresponding notions of classical mathematics. Sometimes they coincide with already known notions in fuzzy literature. However, we are usually more general (we work in arbitrary fuzzy logic), more expressive (we deal with the \\em graded properties of fuzzy relations, as in \\citeGottwald:Treatise), and the proofs are more elegant (resembling the classical proofs).","","Teorie fuzzy rozkladů množin je důležitou součástí jakékoliv teorie, jež poskytuje formální rámec pro fuzzy matematiku. Jako tento rámec navrhl autor spolu s L. Běhounkem Henkinovskou fuzzy logiku vyššího řádu. Zde proto zkoumáme teorii fuzzy rozkladů v tomto konkrétním formalismu. V souladu s metodologickými pravidly tohoto formalismu jsou všechny zde uvedené pojmy inspirované příslušnými pojmy klasické matematiky. V některých případech jsou výsledkem pojmy a tvrzení ve fuzzy literatuře již známé. Většinou jsou ovšem naše výsledky obecnější (pracujeme v libovolné logice), silnější (pracujeme s tzv. stupňovanými vlastnostmi fuzzy relací) a naše důkazy těchto tvrzení jsou mnohem elegantnější (připomínají ty klasické).","BA","","","EUSFLAT - LFA 2005.

The recent changes of the latter do not depart from the range of natural phase fluctuations observed in the historical temperature records. Significant, geographically dependent correlations of the phase fluctuations with the North Atlantic Oscillation index, as well as weaker, negative correlations with the El Nino Southern Oscillation index have been observed.","","Dlouhodobé záznamy průměrných denních teplot vzduchu z několika evropských stanic byly zpracovány s cílem získat okamžitou fázi ročního cyklu. Byly potvrzeny nedávno pozorované změny této fáze, zejména předbíhání jarní sezóny v 90. letech minulého století. Tyto změny však nepřekračují fluktuaci fází ročních cyklů pozorovaných v dlouhodobých záznamech, naopak fluktuace načasování sezón jsou přirozeným dynamickým procesem. Tento proces souvisí s globálními cirkulačními procesy v atmosféře, jak naznačuje nalezená, statisticky významná korelace s indexem severoatlantické oscilace, jako i slabší, negativní korelace s jižní oscilací El Nino.","DC","spoluprace_08","cena05","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2005","2006","10","10.1029/2005GL022838","wos:000229986900006","2-s2.0-25844502471","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0125678","","1","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most of the ANN-based rule extraction methods rely primarily on heuristics, and their underlying theoretical principles are not very deep. That is especially much true for methods extracting fuzzy logic rules, which usually allow to mix different logical connectives in such a way that extracted rules can not be correctly evaluated in any particular fuzzy logic model. This paper shows that mixing of connectives is not needed. A method for fuzzy rules extraction for which the evaluation of the extracted rules in a single model is the basic principle is outlined and illustrated on a case study with EEG data.","","Extrakce logických pravidel z dat je klíčovou aplikací umělých neuronových sítí v dobývání znalostí z dat. Většina metod pro extrakci logických pravidel založených na umělých neuronových sítích však spočívá v první řadě na heuristikách a jejich teoretické základy nejsou velmi hluboké. To je zvláště hodně pravdou pro metody extrakce pravidel fuzzy logiky, které obvykle dovolují míchat logické spojky takovým způsobem, že extrahovaná pravidla není možné korektně ohodnotit v žádném konkrétním modelu fuzzy logiky. Tento článek ukazuje, že míchání spojek není potřebné. Je nastíněna metoda pro extrakci fuzzy pravidel, jejímž hlavním principem je ohodnocování v jediném modelu, a je ilustrována na studii jednoho případu s EEG daty.","BA","","","ICANNGA'2005 /7./.

For the discretized problem we employ the concept of local Schur complements, grouping every two subdomains which share a contact area.

Saad and M. Schultz,SIAM J. Sci. Statist. Comput., 7 (1986), pp. 856-869] for solving linear systems Ax=b is implemented as a sequence of least squares problems involving Krylov subspaces of increasing dimensions. The most usual implementation is modified Gram-Schmidt GMRES (MGS-GMRES). Here we show that MGS-GMRES is backward stable. The result depends on a more general result on the backward stability of a variant of the MGS algorithm applied to solving a linear least squares problem, and uses other new results on MGS and its loss of orthogonality, together with an important but neglected condition number, and a relation between residual norms and certain singular values.","","Metodu zobecněných minimálních reziduí (GMRES) [Y.

Whereas analysis of the initial phase of convergence was successfully accomplished, theoretical description of the second period, quantifying the observed convergence acceleration, has not been undertaken so far.Exploiting tools that were used in the papers of Liesen and Strakoš about the model given to explain the period of slow convergence,we propose to analyze the phase that follows by considering a diagonal translation of the linear system. In this manner we can separate components of the system matrix that change significantly around the Nth iteration from the remaining components.We derive an upper residual bound that is based on this separation and demonstrate its accuracy on numerical examples.","","Když aplikujeme metodu GMRES na soustavu lineárních rovnic vzniklou při diskretizaci SUPG modelového konvexního-difusního problému na sítě velikosti NxN, pak konvergenční křivky ukazují pomalý pokles během počátečních kroků a náhle se stávají prudší kolem N-té iterace. Analýza počáteční fáze konvergence byla úspěšně provedena, ale teoretický popis druhé fáze, s kvantifikací pozorovaného zrychlení zatím nebyl uskutečněn. Použitím nástrojů z článků Liesen, Strakoš o dané problematice pro vysvětlení fáze pomalé konvergence navrhujeme analýzu další fáze pomocí diagonálního posunu lineární soustavy. Tímto způsobem můžeme oddělit komponenty systémové matice, které se kolem N-té iterace výrazně změní od ostatních komponent.

This hard combinatorial optimization problem is reduced to the minimum energy problem in Hopfield nets by a linear-size construction. The Hopfield network powered by simulated annealing (i.e. Boltzmann machine) which is implemented in a program HTGEN can be used for computing the semi-optimal stripifications. Practical experiments confirm that one can obtain much better results using HTGEN than by a leading stripification program FTSG although the running time of simulated annealing grows rapidly near the global optimum.","","Důležitá úloha generování minimálního počtu sekvenčních trojúhelníkových pásů (tristrips) pro daný triangulovaný povrchový model je motivována aplikacemi v počítačové grafice.

Boltzmannův stroj), která je implementována v programu HTGEN, lze použít k výpočtu semioptimálních stripifikací.

A synchronization technique is introduced so that the results concerning the non-learnability of spiking neurons with binary delays are generalized to arbitrary delays. In particular, the consistency problem for N with programmable delays and its approximation version are proven to be NP-complete. It follows that the spiking neurons with arbitrary synaptic delays are not properly PAC-learnable and do not allow robust learning unless RP=NP. In addition, the representation problem for N, i.e., a question whether an n-variable Boolean function given in DNF (or as a disjunction of O(n) threshold gates) can be computed by a spiking neuron, is shown to be coNP-hard.","","Studujeme výpočetní složitost trénování jednoho spiking neuronu N s binárně kódovanými vstupy a výstupem, který má kromě adaptivních vah a prahu nastavitelná synaptická zpoždění.

Konkrétně je ukázáno, že problém konzistence pro N s programovatelnými vahami, prahem a zpožděními, a jeho aproximační verze jsou NP-úplné. Z toho vyplývá, že spiking neurony s libovolnými synaptickými zpožděními nejsou naučitelné v rámci vlastního PAC modelu a nepřipouští robustní učení, pokud neplatí RP=NP. Navíc ukážeme, že problém reprezentace, tj. otázka, zda booleovskou funkci n proměnných v DNF (nebo vyjádřenou jako disjunkci O(n) prahových hradel) lze počítat pomocí spiking neuronu, je coNP-těžký.","BA","spoluprace_08","cena05","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2005","2006","12","10.1162/089976605774320601","wos:000232530300005","2-s2.0-27144501832","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0125473","","1","","","","","","","","","",""

The presented formalism is strong enough to serve as foundations of a large part of fuzzy mathematics. Its essence is elementary fuzzy set theory, cast as two-sorted first-order theory over fuzzy logic, which is generalized to simple type theory. We show a reduction of the elementary fuzzy set theory to fuzzy propositional calculus and a general method of fuzzification of classical mathematical theories within this formalism.

Jeho podstatou je elementární teorie fuzzy množin, vybudovaná jako dvousortová teorie prvního řádu nad fuzzy logikou; ta je dále zobecněna na jednoduchou teorii typů.

The main theoretical results concern direction determination and step-length selection. We split inequality constraints into active and inactive parts to overcome problems with instability. Inactive constraints are eliminated directly, whereas active constraints are used for defining a symmetric indefinite linear system. Inexact solution of this system is obtained iteratively using indefinitely preconditioned conjugate gradient method. Theorems confirming efficiency of the indefinite preconditioner are introduced. Furthermore, a new merit function is defined and a filter principle is used for step-length selection. The algorithm was implemented in the interactive system for universal functional optimization UFO. Results of numerical experiments are reported.","","V tomto článku popisujeme algoritmus pro řešení problémů nelineárního nekonvexního programování, který je založen na principu vnitřních bodů. Hlavní teoretické výsledky se týkají určení směrového vektoru a volby délky kroku. Omezení s nerovnostmi rozdělíme na aktivní a neaktivní, abychom předešli problémům s nestabilitou. Neaktivní omezení vyeliminujeme a aktivní omezení použijeme pro vytvoření symetrického indefinitního lineárního systému. Nepřesné řešení tohoto systému dostaneme iteračně použitím indefinitně předpodmíněné metody sdružených gradientů. Dále uvádíme věty týkající se efektivity indefinitního předpodmiňovače, definujeme novou pokutovou funkci a pro volbu délky kroku používáme princip filtru.

Feature extraction is a procedure which maps original patterns into the feature (or factor) space of reduced dimension. In this paper we demonstrate that Hebbian learning in Hopfield-like neural network is a natural procedure for unsupervised learning of feature extraction. Due to this learning, factors become the attractors of network dynamics, hence they can be revealed by the random search.

Mirror neurons present a versatile self-learning mechanism for the coordination of perceptional and motor actions. They also seem to present a potential bridge between minds. An understanding of the coupling of perception with actions via the mirror neurons, and the management of the respective internal representations, has opened the road to elucidating the computational principles underlying human cognition.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2003","2004","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0125363","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, such families posses super-Turing computational power. From computational complexity point of view the above mentioned results rank the respective families of neuromata among the most powerful computational devices known today.","","","BA","","","SOFSEM 2002 Workshop on Soft Computing.

It is shown that polynomial-time computations by nondeterministic Turing machines can be reduced to the process of minimizing the energy in Hopfield nets (the MIN ENERGY problem). Furthermore, external and internal sources of energy are distinguished. The external sources include e.g. energizing inputs from so-called Hopfield languages, and also certain external oscillators that prove finite analog Hopfield nets to be computationally Turing universal. On the other hand, the internal source of energy can be implemented by a symmetric clock subnetwork producing an exponential number of oscillations which are used to energize the simulation of convergent asymmetric networks by Hopfield nets.

To explore interaction from a computational viewpoint, we describe a generic model of an 'interactive machine' which interacts with the environment using single streams of input and output signals over a simple alphabet. Viewing the interactive machines as transducers of infinite streams of signals, we show that their interactive recognition and generation capabilities are identical.","","","BA","invited paper","","MFCS'2000.

We apply the method to two types of textual data on Neural Networks.

Classification forests grown by the Random Forests method are used for classifying EEG segments, and distinguishing somnolence from other brain states. A novel approach to classifier (forest) construction is proposed: An individual model tailored for a single subject, using only the subject’s own data, may be combined with a global model trained on data of a number of different subjects. Combining is realized via a weighted average of votes for classes, where the weights result from a simple optimization procedure. A modification of OOB estimates was implemented in order to keep the misclassification error estimates unbiased. The results of a computational experiment with several hundreds of EEG spectra from 18 subjects prove the superiority of the mixed model over both of its components, i.e. individual and global models.","","","BB","","znova do RIV místo smazaného 0088212 rok sběru 2008","ISI 2007.

We will study a possible place and role of mirror neurons in the neural architecture of embodied cognitive agents. We will formulate and investigate the hypothesis that mirror neurons serve as a mechanism which coordinates the multimodal (i.e., motor, perceptional and proprioceptive) information and completes it so that the agent remains always situated even when parts of the multimodal information are missing. We show that such a hypothesis forms a basis on which plausible explanation of the development of a host of mental abilities could be founded. These abilities range from imitation learning; communication via, a sign language Lip to the dawn of thinking. Our results build a bridge between the theory of embodied cognition and mirror neurons; they also justify the hopes related to the discovery of mirror neurons.","","","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2003","2011","1","","wos:000223160700003","2-s2.0-4043111320","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0185940","","0","","","","","","","","","",""

The solution involves modeling architecture in SOFA meta-model, specification of component behavior via extended behavior protocols, checking behavior compliance of components, verification of correspondence between selected component Java code and behavior specification, deployment to SOFA run-time environment (using connectors that support RMI and JMS), and modeling of performance and resource usage via layered queuing networks. We faced several issues during implementation of the CoCoME assignment in SOFA 2.0. Most notably, the architecture was modified in order to improve clarity of the design – in particular, the hierarchical bus was replaced by two separate buses and the Inventory component was restructured. Extended behavior protocols for all the components are based on the provided plain-English use cases, the UML sequence diagrams, and the reference Java implementation","","","JC","","cena09 kolize09 grant  ITEA/EUREKA(EU) OSISRS S!2023 nahrada M (Sysno 0310728 zruseno)","Dagstuhl Research Seminar for Component Modelling Example.

This, however, makes BPMN unsuitable for direct execution. On the other hand, the Business Process Executable Language (BPEL), which is directly executable, is a natural choice for implementing business processes, but its use requires programming skills. This dichotomy can be solved by transforming BPMN into BPEL. However, the existing transformation methods have a common problem which is either incompleteness or loss of intentions, which makes BPEL difficult to modify and debug as well as to propagate changes back to BPMN. We present an approach to address this problem by enhancing an existing transformation algorithm to provide a complete transformation while preserving a large set of intentions expressed in the BPMN description, which makes it suitable for model-driven development.","","","JC","","cena09 kolize09 grant TEA/EUREKA(EU) OSIRIS S!2023 nahrada M (Sysno 0317127 zruseno)","ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering Research, Management and Applications /6./.

This would have consequences for the relationalship between deterministic and probabilistic computations in the respective models. Using the result by Alon, Goldreich, Hastad, and Peralta (1992) we provide a polynomial time constructible hitting set for restricted read-once branching programs of width 3. The restriction excludes only one from all patterns of level-to-level transitions in a normalized form of 3-width 1-branching programs. In fact, our technique works for a slightly more general class of such programs.

The method uses an interval constraint propagation based solver to solve these constraints. This has the advantage that without complicated algorithmic changes the method can be improved by just changing these constraints. In this paper, we discuss various possibilities of such changes, we prove some properties about the amount of over-approximations introduced by the new constraints, and provide some timings that document the resulting improvement.","","","BA","","náhrada J","AISC 2006.

In such structures newly trained assemblies take advantage of their overlaps with the already trained neighbors. The assemblies learned in such manner nevertheless preserve the ability for subsequent separate firing. We discuss the implications it may have for intensification of neural network training methods and we also propose to view this learning speed-up in a broader context of inter-assembly cooperation useful for modeling concept formation in human thinking.","","","BB","","náhrada J","ICANN 2006.

Modus Ponens, which is the classical example of a conditional deduction rule, expresses a conditional relationship between an antecedent and a consequent. A generalization of Modus Ponens to probabilities in the form of probabilistic conditional inference is also well known. This paper describes a method for conditional deduction with beliefs which is a generalization of probabilistic conditional inference and Modus Ponens. Meaningful conditional deduction requires a degree of relevance between the antecedent and the consequent, and this relevance can be explicitly expressed and measured with our method. Our belief representation has the advantage that it is possible to represent partial ignorance regarding the truth of statements. Conditional deduction with beliefs thereby allows partial ignorance to be processed.","","","BA","","náhrada J","ECSQARU 2005. European Conference /8./.

Apart from their primary function, which is mediating the communication, their implementation can also support additional features that, while unrelated to the primary function, may benefit from their placement in connectors. Such features are often optional in the sense that they can be activated and deactivated at run-time. The problem is that even if they are disabled, their very presence in the connector incurs certain overhead. In this paper, we describe an approach to eliminate this overhead by reconfiguration of the connector implementation. Besides connectors, the approach is applicable to similar technologies such as reflective middleware and other architecture-based component systems and frameworks.","","","JC","CEZ:MSM0021620838","náhrada J","EWSA 2006.

Frequently a better approximation may be expected, if the prediction function of the original tree is replaced by a continuous approximation. The approximation is constructed using the same training data on which the original tree was grown and the structure of the tree is preserved. The current paper uses the model of trees with soft splits suggested by Quinlan and implemented in C4.5, however, the training algorithm is substantially different. The method uses simulated annealing, so it is quite computationally expensive. However, numerical test with data derived from an experiment in particle physics shows that besides the expected better approximation of the training data, also smaller generalization error is achieved.","","","BA","","náhrada J","ICANNGA'2007 /8./.

The RCWA method assumes a specific form of gratings which enables a straightforward separation of space variables. Using Fourier expansions, the solutions of the resulting systems of ordinary differential equations for the Fourier amplitudes can after truncation be written in a form of matrix functions, with an elegant formulation of the linear algebraic problem for integrating constants. In our text we present derivation of the RCWA method, we formulate open questions which still need to be addressed and discuss perspectives of efficient solution of the related highly structured linear algebraic problems. A detailed understanding of the RCWA method for the two-dimensional grating is in our opinion necessary for development of successful generalization of the method to practical problems.","","Rozptyl světla na periodickém povrchu představuje důležitý problém s mnoha fyzikálními a inženýrskými aplikacemi.

When errors in the data are confirmed both to B and A, the total least squares (TLS) concept is used to solve this problem. Contrary to the standard least squares approximation problem, a solution of the TLS problem may not exist. For a single (vector) right-hand side, the classical theory has been developed by G.H. Golub, C.F. Van Loan (1980), and S. Van Huffel, J. Vandewalle (1991), and then complemented recently by the core problem approach of C.C. Paige, Z. Strakoš (2002, 2006).

The method described in the paper exploits existing linguistic tools created originally for a syntactically annotated corpus, Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT 2.0).We propose a system which captures text of web-pages, annotates it linguistically by PDT tools, extracts data and stores the data in an ontology. We focus on the third phase - data extraction - and present methods for learning queries over linguistically annotated data. Our experiments in the domain of reports of traffic accidents enable e.g. summarization of the number of injured people. This serves as a proof of concept of our solution. More experiments, for diffrent queries and different domain are planned in the future. This will improve third party semantic annotation of web resources.","","Nedostatek sémanticky anotovaných informací představuje ""úzké hrdlo"" pro sémantické webové služby. Zabýváme se lingvistickou extrakcí informací z českých textů pocházejících z webových stránek. Náš cíl je použít tyto informace pro sémantickou anotaci. Zabýváme se návrhem systému, který získá text z webových stránek, lingvisticky ho anotuje, extrahuje z něj data a tato data uloží do ontologie. V tomto příspěvku se zaměříme na třetí fázi našeho systému (extrakci dat) a ukážeme metodu tvorby dotazů nad lingvisticky anotovanými daty. Naše experimenty na datech o dopravních nehodách umožňují například sumarizovat počet zraněných osob při nehodách a slouží jako ověřené správnosti našeho řešení. V budoucnu bude nutné provést rozsáhlejší experimenty v různých doménách s různými dotazy. Naše metoda umožní zlepšit sémantickou anotaci webových stránek z vnějšku - třetí stranou.","IN","","atestace2013ne","IDC 2008. International Symposium on Intelligent and Distributed Computing /2./.

While traditional fuzzy logic admits various interpretations of membership degrees, deductive fuzzy logic always interprets them as degrees of truth preserved under inference. The latter fact imposes several constraints on systems of deductive fuzzy logic, which need not be followed by mainstream fuzzy logic. That makes deductive fuzzy logic a specific area of research that can be characterized both methodologically (by constraints on meaningful definitions) and formally (as a specific class of logical systems). An analysis of the relationship between deductive and traditional fuzzy logic is offered.","","Metodologické rozdíly mezi tradiční a deduktivní fuzzy logikou jsou v článku demonstrovány na třech případových studiích týkajících se pojmů Duboisových-Pradových graduálních prvků, entropie fuzzy množiny a agregačních operátorů. Na rozdíl od tradiční fuzzy logiky, která připouští rozmanité interpretace stupňů příslušnosti, deduktivní fuzzy logika je interpretuje zásadně jako stupně pravdivosti zachovávané inferencí. To podřizuje systémy deduktivní fuzzy logiky určitým omezením, kterými tradiční fuzzy logika není vázána. Deduktivní fuzzy logika je proto jejím specifickým podoborem, který lze charakterizovat metodologicky (omezeními kladenými na smysluplné definice) i formálně (jakožto určitou třídu logických systémů). Článek rovněž poskytuje analýzu vztahu mezi deduktivní a tradiční fuzzy logikou.","BA","","cena09","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2008","2009","6","10.1016/j.fss.2007.12.004","wos:000255470500003","2-s2.0-40949148659","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0172801","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Infections of mother or newborns have been documented among these risk factors. The model of pre/perinatal infection was focused on the administration of bacterial agents (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) to pregnant rats or directly to pups. The long-term consequences of LPS administration on behaviour were observed in relation to the effect of chronic clozapine (CLZ) administration. This therapy in the postnatal LPS induced smaller weight gain, normalized the deficit in locomotion, but had no effect on prepulse inhibition. The prenatal infection-affected CLZ-treated rats expressed a better prepulse inhibition. The results demonstrate the differing vulnerability of the brain to infectious processes. The present study suggests that oral administration of CLZ may be a suitable alternative approach for further testing the effect of antipsychotics in preclinical research.","","FL","","cena09","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2008","2009","","","","2-s2.0-55249089025","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0172522","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method is a bit less efficient than the standard maximum likelihood method, however it is more robust. Simulation study emphasize the fact that crucial role is played by level of contamination. In cases of very small contamination, both methods give similar results. The larger contamination, the better are the t-moment estimates.

Pro malou kontaminaci dávají obě metody podobné výsledky, čím je však kontaminace vyšší, tím lépe pracuje nova metoda.

We call it the t-score. By means of t-scores, it is possible to introduce new characteristics of the central tendency and variability of probability distributions. The estimates of the new measures can be constructed from the usual estimates of the parameters, but we show a more straightforward and computationally often more simple way: the use of a modification of the generalized moment method. Since the estimates are robust in cases of heavy-tailed distributions, our approach appears to be particularly important in study of extreme events.","","Cílem práce je vysvětlit smysl zavedení skalární inferenční funkce, kterou nazývám t-score.  Pomocí t-skórů se dají zavést nové charakteristiky polohy a měřítka pravděpodobnostních rozdělení. K odhadům těchto charakteristik lze použít běžných parametrických odhadů, ale přímočařejší a často jednodušší cestou je použít zobecněnou momentovou metodu pro t-skóry.  Protože odhady jsou pro rozdělení s těžkými konci robustní, tyto odhady jsou užitečné při odhadování vlastností chvostů rozdělení.","BB","","cena09","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2008","2009","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0170433","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This contribution is focused on the logical describing of watermarking method. In this paper basic analysis for the process of watermark implementation is presented. Comparing of two digital watermarking methods, both based on discrete orthogonal transforms, is described. In generally, discrete orthogonal transforms (mainly DCT) is a base for loss image compression. All information, which may be lost during lossy compression, is possible to leave in the image and these information may be modified during watermark embedding. Thus, a question is satisfying of remaining watermark requirements.","","Článek prezentuje některé vlastnosti digitálního vodotisku digitálních obrazů založeného na diskrétních ortogonálních transformacích (DCT - diskrétní kosinová transformace a KLT - Karhunenova-Loeveova transformace).

Poisson regression model was applied to evaluate age, period and cohort effects on mortality. An adequate fit of CHD men's mortality provided the age-period-cohort model (p=0.121). Fatal CHD risk in Czech men was significantly depended on age (the risk increasing with age), calendar period (the risk reduced in the recent years), and birth cohort (the risk decreasing with birth cohort). The crucial positive change in the CHD mortality trend was observed after the collapse of communism in 1989, and in men past age 40 years.","","Česká republika patří mezi země s vysokou úmrtnostní na ischemickou chorobu srdeční (ICHS).

It is a part of a broader project aimed at prevention of damage caused by drivers' microsleeps. Random Forests (RF) method was chosen, on account of previous experience, as a base classification tool for the classification tasks studied. It is, however, not only routinely used: Various classification models tailored for a specific individual are constructed by combining a RF model derived from the individual's data with a model based on the data of the other suitably selected individuals. Several model combining strategies are described and results of their application on real-life EEG data in an extensive computational experiment are reported.","","Článek se zabývá vývojem klasifikačních modelů schopných rozlišit na základě elektroencefalografických (EEG) dat somnolenci (ospalost) od jiných stavů mozku, které se typicky vyskytují při řízení automobilu.

Ta však není užívána pouze rutinně: Různé klasifikační modely ""šité na míru"" pro specifickou osobu jsou konstruovány tak, že se model odvozený metodou RF z dat daného jedince kombinuje s modelem založeným na datech jiných vhodně vybraných osob.

However, the execution environment reflecting a complex component model and its changes at runtime is a non-trivial and error-prone application. Hence it is beneficial to simplify and conceptualize the execution environment by having a simple way of describing component compositions and reconfigurations. In this paper we propose a minimalistic language which describes the composition of the component-based system’s infrastructure in a procedural way and thus reduces the execution environment basically to a simple language interpreter.","","Komponentový systém kromě modelu sestává i z exekučního prostředí, jež má za úkol instanciovat komponenty popsané modelem.

Component applications often involve complex interaction patterns such as callbacks and autonomous activities that can be properly modeled only by a formalism that (i) supports independent atomic events for method invocation and return from a method and (ii) allows to specify interleaving of events on component's provided and required interfaces. This paper attempts to answer the question whether a model involving only events on provided interfaces (calling protocol) could be valid under certain constraints on component behavior. The key contribution are the constraints on interleaving of events related to callbacks and autonomous activities, which are expressed via syntactical patterns, and evaluation of the proposed constraints on real-life component applications.","","Populární přístup ke kompoziční verifikaci komponentových aplikací je založen na principu assume-guarantee (předpoklad-záruka), kde předpoklad modeluje chování prostředí pro každou komponentu. Realistické komponentové aplikace často zahrnují složité vzory komunikace jako callbacky a autonomní aktivity, které mohou být přesně modelovány pouze formalismem, který (i) podporuje nezávislé atomické události pro volání metod a návraty z metod a (ii) dovoluje specifikaci explicitních proložení událostí na poskytovaných a požadovaných rozhraních komponenty. Tento článek se pokouší zodpovědět otázku, zda  model zahrnující pouze události na poskytovaných rozhraních (volací protokol) může být korektní při nějakých omezeních na chování komponent. Hlavním přínosem jsou omezení na proložení událostí vztažených ke callbackům a autonomním aktivitám, které jsou vyjádřeny pomocí syntaktických vzorů, a zhodnocení navržených omezení na realistických komponentových aplikacích.","JC","","","TOOLS EUROPE 2008.

In modern component systems, the  communication paths among components are realized by software connectors, which allow explicit modeling of the communication and ease its implementation, especially due to possibility of automatic connector  generation. However, connector generation is a complex task mainly due to wide semantic gap between the abstract specification of a connector at design time and its implementation. In this paper, we present an approach to generating implementations of software connectors. The approach is based on a new domain specific language for describing templates of connector implementations and a transformation framework using the Stratego/XT term rewriting system for generating source code of connectors.","","Komponentově orientované softwarové inženýrství představuje zavedené paradigma, jehož podstatou je model aplikace sestávající z mnoha komponent, které  obsahují pouze aplikační logiku a komunikují pouze prostřednictvím dobře definovaných rozhraní. V moderních komponentových systémech jsou komunikační cesty mezi komponentami realizovány pomocí konektorů, které umožňují modelování komunikace odděleně od aplikační logiky a zjednodušují implementaci komunikačních cest, především díky možnosti automatického generování implementačního kódu konektorů.

In this paper, we propose on-the-fly simulation of the component environment to address the issue. We employ behavior protocols and  a system coordinating two model checkers: Java PathFinder and BPChecker. This approach allows us to enclose the model representing the behavior of a given component and consequently to exhaustively  verify the model. Our solution was implemented as the Carmen tool.

Unlike stateless services, a stateful web service imposes constraints on the order in which the operations of the service may be invoked. However, specification of such constraints is not a standard part of a web service interface, and compliance with such constraints is not checked by the standard web service development tools. In this paper, we propose an extension to a web service interface consisting of a constraint definition based on behavior protocols. We also describe a tool that checks whether a given BPEL code complies with the constraints of all stateful web services it communicates with. The key idea behind the tool is to translate the BPEL code into Java and then to check the Java program using Java PathFinder with behavior protocol extension.","","Přestože webové služby jsou obecně viděny jako bezstavové, některé z nich jsou implicitně stavové. Důvodem jě to, že webové služby často pracují jako front-end k podnikovým systémům a jsou používány jejich klienty relačním způsobem. Narozdíl od bezstavových služeb, pro stavovou službu existují omezení na pořadí, ve kterém operace dané služby mohou být volány. Nicméně, specifikace takových omezení není standardní součástí rozhraní webové služby, a korespondence s těmi omezeními není ověřována běžnými nástroji pro vývoj webových služeb. V tomto článku navrhujeme rozšířit rozhraní webových služeb pomocí definice omezení, která je založena na protokolech chování. Dále jsme implementovali nástroj pro ověřování, jestli BPEL kód splňuje omezení všech stavových webových služeb, se kterými komunikuje.

In the composition, it is assumed that primitive services are known to the composition component in advance. At the same time, in matchmaking algorithms, usually only one service is considered as a suitable  candidate satisfying a query while service combinations are not allowed. The problem is that in realistic composition or mediation scenarios in dynamic environments some specific  gap can be bridged only by using a combination of several services which are not known and need to be discovered.  We consider such a situation and we propose an approach using a combined match and a composed match. We give a characterization of these two matching types and we develop appropriate matching algorithms.","","Problémy kompozice webových služeb a jejich objevování jsou ve většině současných výzkumných prací řešeny odděleně. U kompozice se předpokládá, že primitivní služby jsou známy a že je komponenta realizující kompozici nemusí vyhledávat. Na stranu druhou algoritmy pro vyhledávání služeb obvykle předpokládají, že jako vhodní kandidáti vyhovující vyhledávacímu dotazu mohou být nalezeny pouze individuální služby, zatímco kombinace několika služeb obvykle nebývají povoleny. V reálných situacích (např. kompozice či procesní mediace) v otevřených prostředích je však často možné specifický vyhledávací požadavek uspokojit jen za použití kombinace několika služeb. V tomto článku adresujeme právě takové situace a navrhujeme tzv. kombinované vyhledávání a komponované vyhledávání umožňující vyhledávání skupin služeb uspokojujících daný vyhledávací požadavek.

This research has been motivated by increasingly frequent extraction of non-classification rules, such as association rules and rules of observational logic, in real-world data mining tasks. The paper sketches the typology of rules extraction methods and of their rulesets, and recalls that quality measures for whole sets of rules have been so far used only in the case of classification rulesets. It then proposes three possible ways how such measures can be extended to general rulesets. The paper also recalls the possibility to measure the dependence of classification ruleset on parameters of the classification method by means of ROC curves, and proposes a generalization of ROC curves to general rulesets. Finally, a brief illustration on rulesets extracted by means of the method GUHA is given.","","Článek se zabývá mírami kvality celých souborů pravidel získávaných z dat, jako protikladem k běžněji používaným mírám jednotlivých pravidel.

The quality of the sources is affected by many components that are combined into a measure influencing the reputation of sources. The global repository is designed not only to passively collect data, but also to provide valuable feedback to the sources. The formalism used for description of the global repository is a generalization of the binary matrix formalism, which is narrowly connected with the ideas of the Semantic Web.","","Článek přináší popis globálního virtuálního depozitáře vytvořeného z webových zdrojů za použití dostupných technologií (sémantického) webu.

Jedná se o poruchu kolagenu, typu I. V současnosti je popisováno osm klinicky odlišných typů OI, přičemž typ VIII byl objeven a popsán teprve nedávno.

These mutations result in decreased or structurally poor production of collagen. Severity of OI depends on type and placing mutation in gene of collagen type I.

There are several well known methods and algorithms for factorization of real data but many application areas including information retrieval, pattern recognition and data mining often require processing of binary rather than real data. Unfortunately, the methods used for real matrix factorization fail in the latter case. In this paper we focus on the Boolean Matrix Factorization (BMF), introduce the task and present neural network, genetic algorithm and nonnegative matrix factorization based BMF solvers. The algorithms are tested on several data sets and their results are compared.","","Rozklad matic respektive faktorová analýza je důležitá úloha v oblasti analýzy dat s vysokou dimenzí.

Unlike traditional group averaging approaches, we are faced with the irregularities of individual consumption series posed by inter-individual heterogeneity, including zeros, missing data, and abrupt consumption pattern changes. Our model is of the nonlinear regression type, with individual customer-specific parameters that, nevertheless, have a common distribution corresponding to the nonlinear mixed effects model framework. It is advantageous to build the model conditionally. The first condition, whether a particular customer has consumed or not, is modeled as a consumption status in an individual fashion. The prediction performance of the proposed model is demonstrated using a real dataset of 62 individual customers, and compared with two more traditional approaches: ARIMAX and ARX","","V článku se popisuje model pro předpověď denních hodnot spotřeby zemního plynu individuálních zákazníků.

They endow connective tissue such as blood vessel, lungs and skin with the critical properties of elasticity and resilience. The biology of elastic fibres and microfibrils is complex because they have multiple components, a tightly regulated developmental deposition and unique biomechanical functions. Over the last decade, a considerable amount of new information has emerged describing the protein components of microfibrils. Fibrillin associating microfibrils appear to fulfil several physiological roles, including acting as scaffolding for tropoelastin deposition and elastic fibre formation during elastogenesis, contributing to the elastic properties of the elastic fibres, and maintaining tissue homeostasis (36). Their physiological importance is underscored by the complex spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with mutations in genes encoding microfibrils. This review summarizes current understanding of the role of microfibrils.","","EB","","cena08","Diagnostic, Comprehensive Treatment and Biomechanics of Locomotor Effects.

The main part of the solution is so called HL7 broker that serves as a mediator in the communication between the two incorporated systems and implements procedures defined in the HL7 v.3 standard. Data models which represent the communicating systems towards the HL7 broker are based on the original data models implemented in HISes and are in the proper form, demanded by the HL7 standard. In order to achieve the semantic interoperability of incorporated system the creation of mapping of existing data models to international nomenclatures was necessary. Finally the possibilities of usage of international standards and nomenclatures in comparison to the national ones are discussed.","","Tento článek popisuje postupy vývoje elektronického zdravotního záznamu pro sdílenou péči, což zahrnuje implementaci komunikačního standardu HL7 v.3, jeho aplikace v prostředí existujících nemocničních informačních systémů (NIS) a modelování sémantiky přenášených dat.

But rule-based knowledge representations alone cannot be used for the natural flow of speech. In this paper, optimisation of the naturalness of speech, i.e. the optimal choice of phonetic and phonologic parameters for prosody modelling is sought. We will try to find relevant features (speech parameters) having the basic influence on the fundamental frequency and duration of speech units. If the prosody of the synthesizer is controlled by an artificial neural network (ANN), optimisation of the ANN topology is necessary. The topology of the ANN is also dependent on the number of input neurons which represent the most important speech parameters. The pruning of the ANN based on the several approaches (GUHA method, sensitivities of the synaptic weights, etc.) is a suitable tool for reducing the ANN structure.","","Každý jazyk lze popsat gramatickými pravidly, ale ta sama nestačí pro přirozené znění výstupu hlasového syntezátoru.

Pro faktorizaci reálných dat existuje několik známých metod a algoritmů, ale v mnoha aplikacích včetně vyhledávání informací, rozpoznávání obrazů a data mining se vyžaduje spíše zpracování binárních než reálných dat. Bohužel v binárním případě metody pro faktorizaci reálných dat selhávají. V tomto příspěvku definujeme problém včetně řešícího genetického algoritmu a jsou prezentovány výsledky získané z počítačových experimentů.","IN","","","ETID '08.

Two main approaches are compared: the one that computes the approximate solution in terms of a Krylov space basis from an upper triangular linear system for the coordinates, and the one where the approximate solutions are updated with a simple recursion formula. We show that a different choice of the basis can significantly influence the numerical behavior of the resulting implementation. While Simpler GMRES and ORTHODIR are less stable due to the ill-conditioning of the basis used, the residual basis is well-conditioned as long as we have a reasonable residual norm decrease. These results lead to a new implementation, which is conditionally backward stable, and they explain the experimentally observed fact that the GCR method delivers very accurate approximate solutions when it converges fast enough without stagnation.","","V této práci analyzujeme numerické chování několika metod minimalizujících normu rezidua, které jsou matematicky ekvivalentní metodě GMRES. Porovnáváme dva základní postupy: postup, který je založen na výpočtu aproximace řešení z horní trojúhelníkové soustavy pro její souřadnice a postup, kde jsou aproximace postupně upravovány jednoduchou rekurzní formulí. Práce ukazuje, že volba báze vypočteného prostoru může podstatným způsoben ovlivnit numerickou stabilitu implementace daných metod. Z důvodu špatné podmíněnosti zvolené báze jsou implementace Simpler GMRES a ORTHODIR méně stabilní. Na druhé straně se ukazuje, ze pokud metoda konverguje dostatečně rychle, je báze reziduí dobře podmíněná. Tyto výsledky pak vedou k nove implementaci, která je podmíněně zpětně stabilní, a potvrzují experimentálně známý fakt, že metoda GCR v případě dostatečně rychlé konvergence generuje velice přesné aproximace řešení.","BA","","cena09","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2008","2010","5","10.1137/070707373","wos:000263103700013","2-s2.0-70449371819","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0162481","","1","","","","","","","","","",""

This is a novel approach, since usually pseudo-random number generators are evaluated using tests specifically designed for this purpose. Such specific tests are more sensitive. Hence, detecting the dependence using machine-learning methods implies that the dependence is indeed very strong. The most important example of a generator, where dependencies may easily be found using our approach, is MATLAB’s function rand if the method state is used. This method was the default in MATLAB versions between 5 (1995) and 7.3 (2006b), i.e., for more than 10 years. In order to evaluate the strength of the dependence in it, we used the same machine-learning tools to detect dependencies in some other random number generators, which are known to be bad or insufficient for large simulations.","","Článek popisuje, jak mohou být v některých známých generátorech náhodných čísel detekovány závislosti pomocí obecných nástrojů strojového učení. Jde o nový přístup, protože pseudonáhodné generátory jsou obvykle posuzovány pomocí testů specificky určených pro tento účel. Tyto specifické testy jsou citlivější, proto možnost detekce závislostí pomocí metod strojového učení implikuje, že jde o velmi silné závislosti. Nejdůležitější příklad generátoru, ve kterém lze závislosti snadno najít pomocí našeho přístupu, je funkce rand v MATLAB, pokud je použita metoda state. Tato metoda byla výchozí metodou ve verzích MATLAB mezi 5 (1995) a 7.3 (2006b), tedy více než 10 let. Pro posouzení síly této závislosti jsme použili stejné nástroje strojového učení k detekci závislostí v dalších generátorech, o kterých je známo, že jsou špatné nebo nedostatečné pro rozsáhlejší simulace.","BA","","cena08","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2008","2009","1","10.1080/08839510701768382","wos:000254579900005","2-s2.0-42949118239","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0162468","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For these functions one can use similar polynomial approximations as for the correlation integral. Essential difference is that value of exponent, which would correspond to correlation dimension, differs in accordance to position of point in question. Moreover we show that multiplicative constant represents probability density estimation at that point. This finding is used for construction of a classifier. Tests with some data sets from Machine Learning Repository shows that this classifier can be very effective.","","Ukazuje se, že korelační integrál lze rozložit na funkce, z nichž každá se vztahuje k určitému bodu prostoru dat.

The structured health documentation in dentistry in the form of an EHR is being systematically studied. This paper describes the evolution of the EHR developed in the EuroMISE Center named MUDRLite and its graphical component for dentists called DentCross. The summary of features of the DentCross component is followed by a brief description of automatic speech recognition and an ASR module. The problems with data insertion into EHR during examination of a dental patient lead to further research in the area of the automatic speech recognition in medical practice. DentVoice is a successful application of the ASR module and the DentCross component of the MUDRLite EHR. Voice-controlled data entry makes hand-busy activities in dental practice more comfortable, which results in a better quality of the data stored in dental EHR, better decision making and use of decision support systems.","","EuroMISE centrum se zaměřuje na nové přístupy v oblasti elektronických zdravotních záznamů (EZZ).

Souhrn vlastností komponenty zubního kříže pokračuje stručným popisem techniky automatického rozpoznávání řeči (ARR) a vlastního modulu ARR. Problémy se zadáváním dat do EZZ během vyšetření stomatologického pacienta vedly k dalšímu výzkumu v oblasti uživatelského rozhraní systému a využití ARR v medicínské praxi. Výsledkem je DentVoice, jako úspěšná aplikace ARR modulu a komponenty zubního kříže EZZ MUDRLite. Hlasem ovládané zadávání dat zjednodušuje řadu aktivit ve stomatologické praxi, při kterých lékař nemá volné ruce.

Although the maturity of this technique, there appears to be quite a significant gap between (a) component systems that are rich in advanced features (e.g., component nesting, software connectors, versioning, dynamic architectures), but which have typically only poor or even no run-time support, and (b) component systems with a solid run-time support, but which typically possess only a limited set of the advanced features. In our opinion, this is mainly due to the difficulties that arise when trying to give proper semantics to the features and reify them in development tools and an runtime platform. In this paper, we describe the implementation of the runtime environment for the SOFA 2.0 component model. In particular, we focus on the runtime support of the advanced features mentioned above.","","Vývoj velkých distribuovaných aplikaci pomoci softwarových komponent se v posledních letech stal bežne používanou technikou.

This is often impossible at design time if the component practices unbounded parallelism. In that case, the behavior of the component widely depends on the environment the component is instantiated in. Unfortunately, covering all possible environments results in an infinite-state model. In this paper, we introduce a solution based on the concept of template-to-model transformation: at design time, a developer describes the behavior of the component by a behavior template, which is automatically transformed into a concrete behavior model when the component is instantiated in an environment. As the concrete behavior model is finite-state, it forms a suitable input for verification tools.","","Pro analýzu komponent verifikačními nástroji je vhodné popsat chování komponenty pomocí konečně-stavového modelu. To je vsak často nemožné v době návrhu komponenty, pokud tato používá neomezený paralelismus. V tomto případe totiž chování komponenty závisí na prostředí, ve kterém je komponenta používána, a pokrytí všech možných prostředí pak vede k nekonečně-stavovému modelu. V tomto článku navrhujeme řešení tohoto problému založené na myšlence transformace šablony chování na konkrétní model (template-to-model transformation): v době návrhu komponenty je chování popsáno tzv. šablonou chování, která je automaticky transformována v konkrétní model ve chvíli, kdy je komponenta nasazena v konkrétním prostředí. Tento konkrétní model je již konečně-stavový, a je proto vhodným vstupem verifikačních nástrojů.","JC","","cena08","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2007","2008","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0160567","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Soubor pacientů a metody: Osmi pacientům s těžkým syndromem suchého oka bylo aplikováno AS-oční kapky po dobu 3 měsíců, a to úměrně počtu aplikací umělých slz, maximálně však 8krát denně. Klinické testy a laboratorní testy byly provedeny před a po ukončení aplikace AS-očních kapek. Během studie pacienti denně posuzovali subjektivní stav očí. Výsledky a závěr: Aplikace AS-očních kapek vedla ke statisticky významnému zlepšení hodnot Schirmerova testu, vyšetření detritu a keratitis punctata. Na povrchu spojivky došlo ke zvýšení počtu pohárkových buněk a ke snížení počtu buněk apoptotických. Ve všech pacienty hodnocených kategoriích stavu oka došlo k významnému snížení intenzity nepříjemných pocitů.

Material and methods: The SA eye drops were applied during the period of 3 months in 8 patients with dry eye syndrome with the maximum frequency 8 times a day. The clinical and laboratory examinations were performed at the start and at the end of the 3 months treatment period. Each day, patients reported their ocular status. Results and conclusions: The AS eye drops application improved significantly the values of the Shirmer test, detritus and superficial punctate keratitis as well. The goblet cells density on the conjunctival surface increase and the number of apoptotic cells decreased. The intensity of unpleasant feelings reported by the patients decreased significantly in all of the assessed categories. The application of the AS eye drops application should become common therapeutic practice with dry eye syndrome.","","FF","","cena08 *** atestace2013ne","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2008","2008","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0159916","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The semantic content of developed EHRs was defined by the set of important medical concepts for the diagnosis of cardiological patients named the Minimal Data Model for Cardiological patients (MDMC). This model was a basis for a small EHR called ADAMEK, specially designed to collect data in the outpatients’ environment. MUDRLite was inspired by MUDR EHR and preserved the flexibility of stored data. The MUDRLite2 technology combines the experience of MUDRLite and advanced enterprise programming technologies. The pilot implementation of MUDRLite2 is the AdamekJ application, created as a data collection tool in the field of cardiology and genetics, replacing the ADAMEK EHR. Since all EHR systems are based either directly (ADAMEK, AdamekJ) or indirectly (MUDR, MUDRLite) on the MDMC, the semantic interoperability among them is guaranteed.","","Elektronický zdravotní záznam (EZZ) je v EuroMISE centru studován již dlouhou dobu, díky čemuž bylo vytvořeno široké spektrum systémů EZZ. Sémantický obsah vyvinutých EZZ byl definovaný množinou důležitých medicínských konceptů z oblasti diagnostiky kardiologických pacientů, která byla nazvána Minimální datový model kardiologického pacienta (MDMK). Tento model byl základem pro malý EZZ nazvaný ADAMEK, který byl speciálně vyvinut pro sběr dat v ambulantním prostředí. MUDRLite byl inspirovaný EZZ MUDR a zachoval jeho flexibilitu ukládání dat. Technologie MUDRLite2 kombinuje zkušenosti z tvorby MUDRLite a pokročilé enterprise programovací techniky. Pilotní implementací technologie MUDRLite2 je aplikace AdamekJ, vytvořená pro sběr dat v oblasti kardiologie a genetiky a nahrazuje EZZ ADAMEK. Jelikož všechny zmiňované EZZ jsou založeny buď přímo (ADAMEK, AdamekJ) a nebo nepřímo (MUDR, MUDRLite) na MDMK, je mezi nimi zaručená spolupráce na sémantické úrovni .","IN","","UT ISI","CeHR: International Conference 2007. eHealth: Combining Health Telematics, Telemedicine, Biomedical Engineering and Bioinformatics to the Edge.

We consider several different methods for estimating conditional mutual information. The behavior of each estimator with respect to its free parameter is shown using a linear model where an analytical estimate of conditional mutual information is available. Numerical experiments in detecting coupling directionality are performed using chaotic oscillators, where the influence of the phase extraction method and relative frequency ratio is investigated.","","Odhalení směrovosti vazby mezi systémy je důležitým krokem ve snaze porozumění chování složitých oscilačních systémů.

This measure can be used as a priority of the candidates in order to sort the candidates for manual (human) tuninig. When a human activity is not possible, the rules with uniquely maximal support can be choosen as the best available approximation of the integration rules.The paper concerns two basic kinds of integration rules, equivalency and hierarchy, and selects a structural analysis of attribute domains for estimating a rule support. Moreover the paper brings a dencentralised access for data integration, which is inspired by web technologies.","","IN","","UT ISI","Znalosti 2008. Annual Conference /7./.

Also, data on their demographics and reperfusion strategy were collected. An assessed clinical outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results: The mean age of STEMI patients was 66.9 +/- 2.6 years. The vast majority were men (62.4%). A total of 68.6% STEMI patients received primary reperfusion treatment, 97.0% of them were referred for PPCI and 3.6% were treated with fibrinolytic therapy. Women and elderly patients were less likely to receive reperfusion therapy. The in-hospital mortality was 11.3% for all STEMI patients; 3.5% in reperfused and 25.7% in non-reperfused group (p < 0.001). When adjusting for age, the effect of reperfusion therapy remained significant. Conclusions: In-hospital mortality was significantly reduced in a subgroup of patients who underwent primary reperfusion treatment (PPCI or fibrinolytic therapy).","","Metoda: Do studie bylo zařazeno celkem 744 po sobě jdoucích pacientů se STEMI v letech 2003–2006.

The method for classification of multivariate data is based on local estimate of distribution mapping exponent for each point. Distances of all points of a given class of the training set from a given (unknown) point are searched and it is shown that the sum of reciprocals of DME-th power of these distances can be used as the probability density estimate.

Informational capacity, recall quality and attractor basins size are evaluated. Asymptotic properties of the neural network are revealed by computer simulation for large network size (up to 150000 of neurons). It is shown that the size of attraction basins changes nonmonotonically while sparseness increases: initially it increases and then decreases. Thus in the limit case of high sparseness, it worsens the network ability to correct destroyed prototypes while it improves both informational capacity and recall quality. The gain of information provided by the network due to correction of the destroyed prototypes is used as cumulative index of the network ability to perform the functions of autoassociative memory. There exists an optimal sparseness for which the gain is maximal. The optimal sparseness happened to correspond to brain neural activity.","Atraktorová neuronová síť Hopfieldova typu je analyzována jak pomocí analytických modelů, tak s pomocí počítačové simulace.....","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2004","2005","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0012490","","","","","","","","","","","",""

V první části uvádíme několik přístupů vyjádření toku zahrnující tok v podzemí, povrchové proudění i tok v kanálových systémech. Diskutujeme možnosti zjednodušení rovnic mělkých vod pro pomalé proudění na potenciální tok nebo procesy advekce disperze. V druhé části prezentujeme výsledky ze dvou modelových příkladů toku po povrchu v krajině. Uvažujeme jak advekačně-disperzní reprezentaci, tak i smíšenou hybridní aproximaci pomocí MKP založené na potenciálním toku.","BA","","","SIMONA 2003.

With the aim to allow for reasoning on the behavior, the paper introduces a simple formal model Generic UC View which identifies important abstractions and the relations upon them which target the goal. Among them, the concept of use case expression is the base for the desired reasoning on whether the behavior of an entity complies with the composed behavior of its sub-entities, and the behavior on the communication links of two neighboring entities is compliant.","","Článek představuje jednoduchý formální model Generic UC View, který umožňuje posuzovat chování popsané pomocí případů užití (use cases).

To compare the nature of this rule with a more frequent but also more controversional one, i.e. with Dempster's rule, an algebraic analysis was used. The basic necessary definitions both from the Dempster-Shafer theory and from algebra are recalled. An algebraic investigation of the Dempster's semigroup - the algebraic structure of binary belief functions with the Dempster's rule of combination is briefly recalled as well. After this, a new algebraic structure of binary belief functions with the disjunctive rule of combination is defined. The structure is studied, and the results are discussed in a comparison with those ones of the classical Dempster's rule. In the end, an impact of new algebraic results to the field of decision making and some ideas for future research are presented.","","Na základě nového požadavku - komutování kombinace domněnkových funkcí se zjemněním/zhruběním rámce rozlišení - vzrostla úloha disjunktivního kombinačního pravidla.

Blood pressure and ECG were noninvasively recorded in young, healthy subjects. Three successive measurements were performed: during spontaneous breathing and during paced respiration-at frequencies both higher and lower than that of spontaneous respiration. We demonstrate that the amplitude and frequency of the cardiac rhythm are synchronized for most of the time. The synchronization is stronger during paced respiration at a frequency lower than that of spontaneous breathing. Episodes where the cardiac frequency was driven by the systolic pressure were also detected during slow, paced respiration.","","Kauzální vztahy mezi amplitudou systolického tlaku a frekvencí srdečního rytmu byly analyzovány pomocí metod teorie informace.

The quality of the synthetic speech is the main reason, why they must take into account not only technical equipment but also phonetic and phonological rules. Several years ago only the ability to understand was the main goal of speech synthesizers, whereas today synthesizers output must be as close to natural language as possible. It is a very difficult task to fulfil this requirement because the speech signal is the conjunction of several influences, physiological, technical and linguistic ones. The last two domains are the subjects of this paper.","","Komunikace mezi člověkem a počítačem zajímá experty z řady oblastí. Pro zlepšení kvality syntetické řeči zpravidla nestačí zabývat se pouze technickým zařízením pro syntézu, ale musíme brát v úvahu i fonetická a fonologická pravidla. Jestliže před několika lety byla hlavním cílem řečového syntezátoru pouze srozumitelnost produkované řeči, dnes je požadována maximální věrnost přirozenému jazyku. Předmětem tohoto článku je hledání matematické metody pro výběr těch řečových parametrů (fyziologických a zvláště linguistických), které mají na řízení prosodie řeči podstatný vliv.","BD","","","IEEE ICIT '04.

An important issue is finding a way to possibly statically verify that, for a given setup containing the architecture, no composition errors can occur in any run. The contribution of the paper is bringing an evidence that this can be done by employing behavior protocols and their consent operator.","","Architektura vytvořená ze softwarových komponent může obsahovat chyby (například v důsledku volby parametrů architektury).

First, the result of the second author stating that the Hadamard product of oscillatory tridiagonal matrices of the same order is again an oscillatory tridiagonal matrix, is extended to the class of basic oscillatory matrices introduced recently. Then it is shown that every oscillatory matrix contains a basic oscillatory matrix as a factor. This explains the role of the class of basic oscillatory matrices within the class of oscillatory matrices.","","Tato práce navazuje na dřívější práce obou autorů o totálně nezáporných a oscilačních maticích.

Distribution-mapping exponent (DME) is something like effective dimensionality of multidimensional space. The method for classification of multivariate data is based on the local estimate of distribution mapping exponent for each point. Distances of all points of a given class of the training set from a given (unknown) point are searched and it is shown that the sum of reciprocals of the DME-th power of these distances can be used as probability density estimate. The classification quality was tested and compared with other methods using multivariate data from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

To decrease the number of necessary experiments an optimization algorithm based on a genetic algorithm for deriving subsequent generations from the performance of the members of the preceding generation is described. This procedure is supplemented by using an artificial neural network for establishing relationships between catalyst compositions - or more general speaking - materials properties and their catalytic performance. By combining a trained neural network with the genetic algorithm software virtually computer experiments were done aiming at adjusting the control parameters of the optimization algorithm to the special requirement of catalyst development. The approach is illustrated by the search for new catalytic compositions for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.","","V prùbìhu objevování nových složení katalyzátorù kombinatorickými metodami v heterogenní katalýze musí být obvykle pøipraveny a testovány rùzné potenciální katalytické slouèeniny.

In experiments MN showed activity both when a subject performed an action and when it observed the same action performed by self or another (possibly conspecific) subject. We formulate and study possible computational consequences of the hypothesis in which the experimentally observed properties of MN are generalized to other perceptive modalities and the underlying mechanism for coupling sensory and motor information is extended by an associative mechanism serving for completion of cross-modal information composed of perception and motor information. Depending on of what kind of information is completed, the hypothesis opens the door for understanding the mechanisms for sensorimotor coordination, imitation learning, and thinking and is inspiring for the design of such mechanisms in the case of artificial agents. Our results justify the hopes generally related to the discovery of MN.","","Zrcadlové neurony jsou speciální neurony objevené nedávno v mozku primátů.

Informational capacity, recall quality and attractor basins size are evaluated. Asymptotic properties of the neural network are revealed by computer simulation for large network size (up to 150000 of neurons). It is shown that the size of attraction basins changes nonmonotonically while sparseness increases: initially it increases and then decreases. Thus in the limit case of high sparseness, it worsens the network ability to correct destroyed prototypes while it improves both informational capacity and recall quality. The gain of information provided by the network due to correction of the destroyed prototypes is used as cumulative index of the network ability to perform the functions of autoassociative memory. There exists an optimal sparseness for which the gain is maximal. The optimal sparseness happened to correspond to brain neural activity.","","Asociativní paměť založená na řídce kódované atraktorové neuronové síti je analyzována jak pomocí analytického modelu jejího makroskopického chování, tak pomocí simulace Monte Carlo. Asymptotické chování neuronové sítě bylo nalezeno pomocí počítačových simulací pro velký počet neuronů (až 150000). Je ukázáno, že velikost bazénu atrakce se nemonotónně mění v závislosti na řídkosti kódování. Zpočátku se zvětšuje, potom opět klesá. To znamená v limitním případě řídkého kódování dochází ke ztrátě schopnosti sítě asociativně obnovovat poškozené prototypy, avšak stoupá její kapacita a kvalita vyhledávání.

Such data belong to two classes, originating either from incident gamma rays or caused by hadronic showers. There is only a weak discrimination between signal (gamma) and background (hadrons), making the data an excellent proving ground for classification techniques. The data and methods are described, and a comparison of the results is made. Several methods give results comparable in quality within small fluctuations, suggesting that they perform at or close to the Bayesian limit of achievable separation. Other methods give clearly inferior or inconclusive results.

This problem has been studied previously by Ipsen and Eiermann and Ernst, but we formulate and prove our results in a different way. Intuitively, when a scaled Jordan block is extended to a tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix by a superdiagonal of small modulus (compared to the modulus of the subdiagonal), the GMRES residual norms for both matrices and the same initial residual should be close to each other. We confirm and quantify this intuitive statement. We also demonstrate principal difficulties of any GMRES convergence analysis which is based on eigenvector expansion of the initial residual when the eigenvector matrix is ill-conditioned.","","V práci je analyzováno chování metody GMRES pro soustavy s třídiagonální Toeplitzovskou maticí.

Main theoretical results concern direction determination and step-length selection. We split inequality constraints into active and inactive to overcome problems with stability. Inactive constraints are eliminated directly while active constraints are used to define symmetric indefinite linear system. Inexact solution of this system is obtained iteratively using indefinitely preconditioned conjugate gradient method. Theorems confirming efficiency of several indefinite preconditioners are proved. Furthermore, new merit function is defined, which includes effect of possible regularization. This regularization can be used to overcome problems with near linear dependence of active constraints.

Hlavní teoretické výsledky se týkají určení směrového vektoru a volby délky kroku. Omezení, ve kterých se vyskytují nerovnosti, rozdělíme na aktivní a neaktivní, abychom předešli problémům se stabilitou. Neaktivní omezení vyeliminujeme a aktivní omezení použijeme k vytvoření symetrického indefinitního lineárního systému. Ten řešíme iteračně použitím metody sdružených gradientů s indefinitním předpodmiňovačem. Jsou dokázány věty potvrzující efektivitu některých předpodmiňovačů. Kromě toho je definována nová pokutová funkce, která zahrnuje vliv regularizace, kterou je možné použít k překonání problémů, kdy jsou aktivní omezení téměř lineárně závislé.

The key idea behind bad activity is that the asymmetry of roles during event exchange typical for real programs should be honored: the caller is considered to be the initiator of the call (callee has only a passive role). In most formal systems, this is not the case. We propose a new composition operator, ""consent"", reflecting these types of errors by producing erroneous traces. In addition, by using the consent operator, it can be statically determined, whether the atomicity of a dynamic update of a component is implicitly guarantied thanks to the behavior of its current environment.","","Práce demonstruje několik druhů chyb, které mohou vzniknout v důsledku kompozice softwarových komponent: ""bad activity"", ""no activity"" a "" divergence"".

Basically, it consists in checking the null hypothesis that the probability distribution, a priori assumed to belong to a certain a priori delimited set of distributions, actually belongs to some its narrow subset, which must be precisely delimited in advance. However, sometimes there are not enough clues for such a precise delimitation, especially if the purpose of the data analysis is explorative, a situation encountered increasingly often, due to the growing amount of routinely collected data and the increasing importance od data mining.

In particular, we stress that a formal rejection of a linear stochastic null hypothesis does not automatically mean an evidence for nonlinear dynamical origin of studied data. In an example we show how a variable variance could be mistaken for nonlinearity in a series of surface air pressure. Therefore we find a detection of nonlinearity in a series of sunspot numbers insufficient for an identification of a mechanism underlying the sunspot cycle. As a solution in this case we propose to test for a property of nonlinear oscillators - mutual dependence between their instantaneous amplitude and frequency. This behavior is detected in yearly and monthly records of the sunspot numbers using histogram-adjusted isospectral surrogate data and Barnes model as ARMA surrogates...","","Po stručném náčrtu testu nelinearity založeného na informačně-teoretických funkcionálech a tzv. surrogate data metody vysvětlujeme, že formální odmítnutí nulové hypotézy lineárního stochastického procesu neznamená automaticky důkaz existence nelineárního dynamického systému generujícího studovaná data.

The results are illustrated by examples of estimates of such parameters for functions in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.","","Článek shrnuje logický přístup ke studiu preference a navrhuje její začlenění do relačních dotazovacích jazyků pomocí preferenčního operátoru parametrizovaného množinou preferencí různých druhu a vracejícího nejvíce preferované podmnožiny jeho argumentu - instance relace.

In many practical applications – for example grading – there is a natural ordering between class values. Furthermore, some attribute values of classified objects can be ordered, too. The standard approach in this case is to convert the ordered values into a numeric quantity and apply a regression learner to the transformed data. This approach can be used just in case of linear ordering. The proposed method for such a classification lies on the boundary between ordinal classification trees, classification trees with monotonicity constraints and multi-relational classification trees. The advantage of the proposed method is that it is able to handle non-linear ordering on the class and attribute values. For the better understanding, we use a toy example from the semantic web environment - prediction of rules for the user’s evaluation of hotels.","","Klasifikační metody obvykle předpokládají neuspořádané třídy hodnot klasifikace.

The induction is achieved via multiple use of classical two valued induction on alpha-cuts of fuzzy examples with monotonicity axioms in background knowledge, which is afterwards again glued together to a single annotated hypothesis.

IRESs were first discovered in certain eukaryotic viruses where they very often play a pivotal role in viral strategies, allowing the viral invader to overcome the overall decrease of the host protein synthesis caused either by viral proteins or by the cellular antiviral defense system. Although the IRES segments were first described in viruses, extensive evidence has appeared in the past few years that a similar principle of the translation initiation is utilized also by some cellular mRNAs. This chapter presents the current status of the IRESite database (http://www.iresite.org), the complete list of known viral and cellular IRESs as well as novel results obtained from the comparative analyses of IRES segments accumulated to date.","","Práce sumarizuje stav současného poznání o interních vazebných místech pro ribozóm (IRES) a analyzuje na základě dat soustředěných v databázi IRESite (http://www.iresite.org) některé jejich vlastnosti. IRES se nacházejí nejčastěji v 5' nepřekládaných oblastech RNA některých virů a buněčných transkriptů, kde umožňují překlad příslušných mRNA i v případě, kdy je celková úroveň buněčné proteosyntézy významně snížena, například při virové infekci, při buněčném stresu, při apoptóze atd.","IN","","cena08","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2007","2008","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0155910","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Článek shrnuje nejdůležotější rozdíly a dává metodologické pokyny pro smysluplné budování nových teorií, definování nových pojmů a dokazování nových vět formální fuzzy matematiky.","BA","","","IFSA 2007.

Conjunctive fuzzy systems are the systems which employ fuzzy conjunctions for combination of antecedents (IF parts) with consequents (THEN parts) in theirs IF-THEN rules. Radial fuzzy systems are the systems which employ radial functions for representation of membership functions of incorporated fuzzy sets; and exhibiting the radial shape preservation property.

This worst-case bound is sharp (i.e. it is attainable by the relative GMRES residual norm) in case of a normal matrix A , but it need not characterize the worst-case GMRES behavior if A is nonnormal. Characterizing the tightness of this bound for nonnormal matrices A represents an important and largely open problem in the convergence analysis of Krylov subspace methods. In this paper we address this problem in case A is a single Jordan block. We study the relation between ideal and worst-case GMRES as well as the problem of estimating the ideal GMRES approximation. Furthermore, we prove new results about the radii of the polynomial numerical hulls of Jordan blocks. Using these, we discuss the closeness of the lower bound on the ideal GMRES approximation that is derived from the radius of the polynomial numerical hull.","","Řešíme-li soustavu lineárních algebraických rovnic $Ax=b$ metodou GMRES, lze relativní normu residua omezit shora pomocí tzv. ideální GMRES. Pro normální matice charakterizuje ideální GMRES nejhorší možné chování metody GMRES (worst-case GMRES). Ideální a worst-case GMRES se však mohou lišit pro matice, které nejsou normální. Charakterizace vztahu mezi ideální a worst-case GMRES pro nenormální matice představuje důležitý otevřený problém v oblasti konvergenční analýzy krylovovských metod. V práci se zabýváme tímto problémem pro případ, kdy $A$ je Jordanův blok. Studujeme vztah mezi ideální a worst-case GMRES jakož i odhad hodnoty ideální GMRES v závislosti na iteračním kroku a na vlastním čísle Jordanova bloku.

Using a specific algorithm, for which the numerics depend upon the partition, we demonstrate that the rate of convergence can depend strongly on the choice of the partition. This dependence is shown to be a function of the algorithm and of the choice of problem. Information gleaned from tests using various 2-way partitions leads to new partitions for which some degree of convergence robustness is exhibited. The incorporation of a known correction for approximate Schur complements into the original algorithm yields a modified parallel algorithm which numerical experiments indicate achieves robust convergence behaviour with respect to the choice of partition. We conclude that tests of a parallel algorithm which vary the method of partitioning can provide constructive information regarding the robustness of the algorithm   ...","","V tomto článku je hlavním obsahem vzájemná role dělení grafu, který vyjadřuje oblast modelu, ze které vznikl problém a rychlosti konvergence odpovídajících paralelních numerických algoritmů.

Second reason for this is to show basic differences between Boolean and linear case. So called bars problem is used as the benchmark.

To ensure high dependability, a component application should undergo verification, e.g. model checking, to prove it has certain properties. The implementation of an application is usually too complex to be verified at a formal level; therefore, a model being an abstraction of the implementation is to be used. Behavior protocols are a platform for modeling of software component behavior. In this paper, we propose a method for translation behavior protocols to Promela, which is consequently used as the input for the Spin model checker. Having the Promela code describing the component behavior, one can efficiently check for the behavior compatibility and LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) properties of cooperating software components.","","Používání softwarových komponent patří k moderním přístupům k vytváření rozšiřitelných a spolehlivých aplikací. K zajištění vysoké spolehlivost by komponentová aplikace měla být verifikována, např. podstoupit model checking. Implementace aplikace je většinou příliš složitá, než aby mohla být verifikována na formální úrovni. Proto se používá model, který je abstrakcí této implementace. Behavior Protocols jsou platformou pro modelování chování softwarových komponent. V tomto článku navrhujeme metodu pro překlad specifikace Behavior Protocols do Promely, která je následně použita jako vstup pro model checker Spin.

We present a technique that addresses the problem of state explosion in code checking of primitive components with the Java PathFinder in case the checked property is absence of concurrency errors. The key idea is to reduce parallelism in the calling protocol on the basis of the information provided by static analysis searching for concurrency-related patterns in the component code; by a heuristic, some of the pattern instances are denoted as suspicious. Then, the environment (needed to be available since Java PathFinder checks only complete programs) is generated from a reduced calling protocol so that it exercises in parallel only those parts of the component’s code that likely contain concurrency errors.","","Při model checkingu kódu softwarových komponent, které se vyznačují vysokou úrovní paralelismu, se často vyskytne problem exploze stavového prostoru, bez ohledu na to, že jedna komponenta má obvykle menší stavový prostor než celý systém. Zde prezentujeme techniku, která adresuje problém exploze stavového prostoru pro ověřování kódu primitivních komponent s Java PathFinder v případě, že ověřovaná vlastnost je absence synchronizačních chyb. Klíčová myšlenka je redukce paralelismu ve volacím protokolu na základě informací poskytnutých statickou analýzou, která hledá v kódu komponenty vzory se vztahem k synchronizaci; pomocí heuristiky se některé patterny označí jako podezřelé. Potom se prostředí (potřebné, protože Java PathFinder ověřuje pouze kompletní Java programy) vygeneruje z redukovaného volacího protokolu tak, že se paralelně provádějí pouze ty části kódu komponenty, které pravděpodobně obsahují synchronizační chyby.","JC","","","SEAA 2007.

Despite its maturity, there appears to be quite a significant gap between component systems that are rich in advanced features, and component systems with a solid runtime support, but which typically possess only a limited set of the advanced features. In our opinion, this is mainly due to the difficulties that arise when trying to give proper semantics to the features and reify them in development tools and an runtime platform. In this paper, we describe the implementation of the runtime environment for the SOFA 2.0 component model. In particular, we focus on the runtime support of the advanced features. The described issues and the solution are not specific only to SOFA 2.0, but they are general and applicable to any other component system aiming at addressing such features.","","Vývoj velkých distribuovaných aplikaci pomoci softwarových komponent se v posledních letech stal běžně používanou technikou.

We present our approach to model checking of software components implemented in Java against a high-level specification of their behavior defined via behavior protocols 1, which employs the Java PathFinder model checker and the protocol checker. The property checked by the Java PathFinder (JPF) tool (correctness of particular method call sequences) is validated via its cooperation with the protocol checker. We show that just the publisher/listener pattern claimed to be the key flexibility support of JPF (even though proved very useful for our purpose) was not enough to achieve this kind of checking.","","Přestože existuje několik model checkerů pro software, které ověřují kód proti specifikaci zapsané např. v temporální logice a tzv. assertions, nebo ověřují nízkoúrovňové vlastnosti (jako neošetřené výjimky), žádný z nich nepodporuje ověřování softwarových komponent proti vyšší specifikaci chování.

Otherwise, due to the need to capture exceptions indirectly, the specification becomes very complex, therefore hard to read and, consequently, error-prone. After analyzing potential approaches to introducing exceptions to LTS-based interaction specification (expressed via terms/expressions) in ADL, the paper presents the way we built exceptions into the behavior protocols.

As a result, it may be hard to see (and filter out) the actual interplay among the components in their behavior specification. This paper targets the problem in the scope of behavior protocols. It presents a technique for slicing behavior protocols with respect to a given context (composition), designed to remove the unused behavior from a behavior specification.

Also neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia-like behaviour of rats, which were neonatally treated with quinolinic acid, exhibited a decrease in the hippocampal subunit NR1 protein together with a deficit in the prepulse inhibition of startle reaction (PPI) accompanying schizophrenia. Because changes in the NR1 protein went with changed expression in most of NR2 subunits, it was impossible to reveal a direct relation between the decreased expression of NR1 protein and changed PPI. Therefore, we infused antisense oligodeoxynucleotide specific for NR1 subunit into hippocampi of rats.

The systems are solved by a preconditioned iterative method. We attempt to improve the overall solution process by sharing a part of the computational effort throughout the sequence. Our approach is fully algebraic and it is based on updating preconditioners by a block triangular update. A particular update is computed in a black-box fashion from the known preconditioner of some of the previous matrices, and from the difference of involved matrices. Results of our test compressible flow problems show, that the strategy speeds up the entire computation. The acceleration is particularly important in phases of instationary behavior where we saved about half of the computational time in the supersonic and moderate Mach number cases. In the low Mach number case the updated decompositions were similarly effective as the frozen preconditioners.","","Článek je praktickou ukázkou účinnosti aktualizace přepodmínění iteračních metod pro řešení sekvenci rozsáhlých a řídkých soustav lineárních algebraických rovnic.

The investigated mathematical model is based on the visco-plastic Bingham rheology. The numerical approach is based on the semi-implicit scheme in time and the FE approximation in space. The algorithm is shortly discussed.","","Článek pojednává o řešitelnosti a o numerickém řešení kontaktní úlohy s lokálním vazko-plastickým třením ve vazko-plastické Binghamově rheologii. Modelová úloha představuje jednoduchý hydro-mechanický model, jež je součástí globálního projektu bezpečností oblastí ohrožených hurikány a záplavami. Hlavní myšlenkou projektu je propojit klimatická pozorování a klimatické modely s termohydrodynamickými a termohydromechanickými modely, s cílem odhadnout budoucí poškození oblastí ohrožených sesuvy nestabilních svahů. Studovaný matematický model je založen na vazko-plastické Binghamově rheologii. Numerické řešení je založené na semi-implicitním schématu v čase a aproximaci konečnými prvky v prostoru. Stručně je diskutován též i algoritmus.","BA","","cena07","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2008","2009","2","10.1016/j.cam.2007.04.035","wos:000257350200014","2-s2.0-44449100645","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0150273","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study of fragments of logical systems is an important issue of research in any class of non-classical logics. We study the fragments of nine prominent fuzzy logics to all sublanguages with implication. The results achieved in the paper for those nine logics are usually corollaries of theorems with wide scope of applicability. We show how many of these fragments are really distinct and find axiomatic systems for most of them (we construct strongly separable axiomatic systems for eight logic). Then we fully answer the question for which fragments the corresponding class of algebras forms a variety. Finally, we solve the problem how to axiomatize predicate versions of logics without the lattice disjunction.","","Formální logické systémy fuzzy logiky obvykle obsahují stejné výrokové spojky jako logika klasická a navíc takzvanou 'silnou' konjunkci. Studium fragmentů těchto logik (vzniklých z původních systémů omezením se na podmnožinu logických spojek) je důležité pro pochopení vyjadřovací síly jednotlivých logik a jejich vzájemné srovnání. Obvykle řešené problémy v této oblasti jsou: 1) nalezení axiomatických systémů implicitně zadaných fragmentů 2) studium definovatelností spojek ve fragmentech, které je přímo neobsahují 3) otázka, zda omezením jazyka zůstane algebraická sémantika (třída algeber k danému fragmenu přirozeně náležející) varietou algeber 4) problém axiomatizace predikátové extenze daného fragmentu Tyto problémy jsme studovali nejprve pro obecné logické systémy fuzzy logiky, a poté velmi důkladně pro devět ""prominentních"" fuzzy logik a jejich 144 fragmentů.

In this paper we deal with variants of genetic learning applied for the structure optimization and weights evolution of multi-layer perceptron networks. Several genetic operators are tested, including memetic-type local search, that produce good results in terms of network performace. It is shown, that combining evolutionary algorithms with neural networks can lead to better results than relying on neural networks alone in terms of the quality of the solution (both training and generalization error). Comparison to gradient algorithms in terms of time complexity is discussed which does not bring overly optimistic results sometimes met in literature.","","Hybridní modely kombinující neuronovou síť a genetické algoritmy jsou často studovány s cílem urychlení učení nebo lepšího výkonu výsledné sítě. Prezentujeme varianty genetického učení zaměřené na strukturakní optimalizaci. Hybridní přístupy přinášejí lepčí výsledky, I když porovnání s časovou složitostí gradientních algoritmů nedosahuje optimistických výsledků zmiňovaných v literatuře.","IN","","původní ISBN 1-4244-1340-0 opraveno podle WOS na  978-1-4244-1339-3 *** mazani2011","CEC 2007.

In this paper we deal with variants of memetic genetic learning applied for the structure optimization and weights evolution of multilayer perceptron networks. The memetic approach combines genotype and phenotype evolution together with local search represented here by gradient based optimization. It is shown, that combining memetic algorithms with neural networks can lead to better results than relying on neural networks alone in terms of the quality of the solution (both training and generalization error).","","V článku uvažujeme varianty memetického genetického učení struktury a vah vícevrstvé perceptronové sítě.

Namely, non-monotonic reasoning mechanisms with various kinds of preferences are reviewed in detail, and a way of suiting them to practical database applications is presented. These mechanisms enable to reason simultaneously about sixteen various kinds of preferences. To make the mechanisms useful for practical applications, the assumption of preference specification consistency has to be loosened. This is achieved in two steps: firstly, all the preference specifications are generalized to permit uncertainty, and secondly, not a total pre-order on worlds but a partial pre-order on worlds is used in the semantics, which enables to indicate some kind of conflict among worlds by their incomparability. Most importantly, the semantics of set of preferences is related to that of a disjunctive logic program.","","Článek prezentuje přehled nejnovějších pokroků v oblasti logiky preferencí a navrhuje jejich použití v relačním datovém modelu. Pozornost je věnována zejména nemonotónním mechanismům usuzování a jejich začlenění do databázových aplikaci. Tyto mechanismy umožňují současně pojmout až 16 různých - ostrých a neostrých druhů preferenci včetně preferenci ceteris paribus. Aby byly nemonotónní mechanismy použitelné i pro praktické aplikace, je třeba vypustit předpoklad konzistentní specifikace preferenci. To je realizováno ve dvou krocích: všechny specifikace preferenci dovolují zahrnout určitou míru nejistoty a úplné uspořádání na množině světů je v sémantice nahrazeno uspořádáním částečným, což dovoluje vyjádřit případný konflikt mezi světy. Podstatné také je, že sémantika množiny preferenci je definována pomoci disjunktivního logického programu.","IN","","","ITAT 2007. Conference on Theory and Practice of Information Theory.

It is successful in significantly decreasing the number of iterations of a preconditioned iterative method for solving subsequent systems of a sequence when compared with freezing the preconditioner from the first system of the sequence. In some cases, the updated preconditioners offer a rate of convergence similar to or even higher than the rate obtained when preconditioning with recomputed preconditioners. Since the updates are typically cheap and straightforward, their use is of practical interest.","","V článku uvedeme nové přibližné updaty faktorizovaných nesymetrických předpodmiňovačů pro řešení posloupnosti lineárních algebraických soustav.

The analysis is done, in parallel, for two alternative interpretations of the notion of complement in the complete lattice in question. Supposing that this complete lattice is completely distributive in the defined sense, the entropy value defined by possibilistically independent (noninteractive, in other terms) products of finite sequences of lattice-valued possibilistic distributions are proved to be defined by the supremum value of the entropies defined by particular distributions.","","Entropické funkce s hodnotami ve svazu definované posibilistickou distribucí Pi na prostoru Omega jsou definovány jako střední hodnota (ve smyslu Sugenova integrálu) komplementu hodnoty Pi(omega) pro omega probíhající přes Mmega. Analýza je provedena paralelně pro dvě alternativní interpretace pojmu komplementu v uvažovaném úplném svazu. Pokud je tento úplný svaz úplně distributivní v definovaném smyslu, lze dokázat, že hodnota entropie pro posibilisticky nezávislé (neinteraktivní, jinak řečeno) součiny konečných posloupností posibilistických distribucí s hodnotami ve svazu je rovna supremu hodnot entropií pro jednotlivé posibilistické distribuce.","BA","","","EUSFLAT 2007.

An autopoietic automaton can algorithmically generate an offspring controlled by a program which is a modification of its parent’s program. Autopoietic automata offer a neat framework for investigating computational and complexity issues in the evolutionary self-reproducing processes. We show that the computational power of lineages of autopoietic automata is equal to that of an interactive nondeterministic Turing machine. We also prove that there exists an autopoietic automaton giving rise to an unlimited evolution, provided that suitable inputs are delivered to individual automata.

The adjusted standing-to-supine ratio of the HF cp was s. higher in SH (0.50) than in NT (0.39; P<0.01), but not in WCH (0.40) and MH (0.45). The findings at rest are compatible with increased sympathetic activity and decreased parasympathetic modulation in WCH, with normal autonomic cardiac regulation in MH and SH.","","Aktivita sympatiku byla stanovená pomocí spektrální analýzy variability srdeční frekvence u fenoménu bílého pláště (WCH), maskované hypertense (MH) a trvalé hypertenze (SH) ve srovnání se skutečnou normotenzí (NT). Registroval se elektrokardiografický interval RR a kvantifikovala se nízkofrekvenční (LF) a vysokofrekvenční (HF) komponenta jeho variability. Průměrný věk 1485 vyšetřovaných byl 39 let. Průměrný kazuální krevní tlak byl 122/79 mmHg a průměrný ambulantní tlak byl 124/77 mmHg. Průměrný upravený poměr LF a HF byl 0,81 u NT, u WCH byl signifikantně vyšší (1,11; p<0,001). V tomto poměru se významně nelišily NT, MT (0,97) a SH (0,93). Upravený poměr vstoje a vleže byl u HF komponenty signifikantně vyšší u SH (0,50) ve srovnání s NT (0,39; p<0,01), ne však u WCH (0,40) a MH (0,45). Nálezy v klidu odpovídají zvýšené aktivitě sympatiku a snížené parasympatické modulaci u WCH a normální autonomní srdeční regulaci u MH a SH.","FA","","cena07","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2007","2008","9","10.1097/HJH.0b013e3282efc1fe","wos:000250482600016","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0147621","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper describes a new approach to the separation of their effects, which effectively allows continuous estimation of both radon entry rate and air exchange rate from simultaneous tracer gas (CO) and radon gas measurement data. It is based on a state-space statistical model permitting efficient calculations. After introducing the statistical model formally, its performance is demonstrated on real data from measurements from an experimental room. To verify our method, radon entry rate calculated via proposed statistical model was compared with known reference value. The results from several days of measurement indicated fairly good agreement (up to 5% between reference value radon entry rate and its value calculated via proposed method, on average).","","K tomu, aby bylo možné predikovat koncentraci radonu v budovách za reálných podmínek (ale i k porozumět její dynamice) je nezbytné zohlednit a modelovat změny přísunu radonu i změny v koeficientu výměny vzduchu v čase.

We put this method into an abstraction refinement framework and improve it by developing an additional refinement step that employs interval-constraint propagation to add information to the abstraction without introducing new grid elements. Moreover, the resulting method allows switching conditions, initial states, and unsafe states to be described by complex constraints, instead of sets that correspond to grid elements. Nevertheless, the method can be easily implemented, since it is based on a well-defined set of constraints, on which one can run any constraint propagation-based solver. Tests of such an implementation are promising.","","Navrhneme metodu pro verifikaci bezpečnosti hybridních systémů.

One of the principles used for this reason is a factor analysis. In this paper, we show that Hebbian learning and a Hopfield-like neural network could be used for a natural procedure for Boolean factor analysis (BFA). To ensure efficient BFA, we propose our original modification not only of Hopfield network architecture but also its dynamics as well. In this paper, we describe neural network implementation of the BFA method. We show the advantages of our Hopfield-like network modification step by step on artificially generated data. At the end, we show the efficiency of the method on artificial data containing a known list of factors. Our approach has the advantage of being able to analyze very large data sets while preserving the nature of the data.","","Společný problém, který se objevuje např. ve statistice , analýze dat, zpracování signálů, v oblastech textových dokumentů a neuronových sítích je nalezení vhodné reprezentace dat v prostoru nižší dimenze.

This is often impossible at design time if the component practices unbounded parallelism. In that case, the behavior of the component widely depends on the environment the component is instantiated in. Unfortunately, covering all possible environments results in an infinite-state model. In this paper, we introduce a solution based on the concept of template-to-model transformation: at design time, a developer describes the behavior of the component by a behavior template, which is automatically transformed into a concrete behavior model when the component is instantiated in an environment. As the concrete behavior model is finite-state, it is a suitable input for verification tools.","","Aby se daly použít verifikační nástroje pro analýzu spolehlivosti softwarových komponent, je nutné specifikovat chování komponent pomocí konečně-stavového modelu. To je často nemožné v době návrhu komponenty, pokud tato umožňuje neomezeně paralelní volání služeb; v takovémto případě chování komponenty silně závisí na chování prostředí, ve kterém je komponenta používána. Bohužel, snaha o zachycení chování ve všech možných prostředích zpravidla vyústí v nekonečně-stavový model. V tomto článku proto navrhujeme kompromisní řešení postavené na transformaci šablon chování v modely chování: v době návrhu komponenty je chování popsáno šablonou, která je automaticky transformována v konkrétní model chování v době použití komponenty (návrhu celé aplikace). Protože model konkrétního chování je již konečně-stavový, je vhodným vstupem pro verifikační nástroje.","IN","","","SNPD '06.

The proposed strategy combines a convenient mathematical model, efficient combinatorial algorithms which are robust with respect to changes in the grid structure, and an efficient implementation. The mathematical model uses properties of weighted hypergraphs. Model flexibility enables to describe basic security relations between the nodes such that these relations are preserved under frequent changes in connections of the hypergraph nodes.

The main problem handled in this paper is the following: assuming that $A_(d)$ has some property, under what additional condition(s) can we be sure that the original matrix $A$ possesses the same property? Three properties are investigated: nonsingularity, positive definiteness, and positive invertibility.","","Je řešen tento problém: je dána čtvercová reálná matice A a matice B, která vznikne z  A zaokrouhlením koeficientů A na d desetinných míst.

Thus MTL is complete w. r. t. the class of all finite MTL-chains. In order to reach a deeper understanding of the structure of this class, we consider the extensions of MTL by adding the generalized contraction since each finite MTL-chain satisfies a form of this generalized contraction. Simultaneously, we also consider extensions of MTL by the generalized excluded middle laws introduced in [9] and the axiom of weak cancellation defined in [31]. The algebraic counterpart of these logics is studied characterizing the subdirectly irreducible, the semisimple, and the simple algebras. Finally, some important algebraic and logical properties of the considered logics are discussed: local finiteness, finite embeddability property, finite model property, decidability, and standard completeness.","","Článek se zabývá algebraickou sémantikou fuzzy logik splňujících zobecněný axiom kontrakce nebo zobecněný zákon vyloučeného třetího.

A crucial part of the task is the establishment of the connection between the global view and the local sources. For this purpose, two basic mapping approaches have been proposed: GAV (Global As View) and LAV (Local As View). On the Semantic Web, there can be considered also an ontological approach. In this paper, data integration is solved using ontologies of the sources. To express relationships between the global view and local source schemas, an ontology for the integration system is built. Thus, a schema integration task is transformed to an ontology merging task.","","Integrace dat obvykle poskytuje unifikovaný globální pohled na několik datových zdrojů.

The validation was performed within the 20-year primary prevention study of atherosclerotic risk factors (STULONG). The accuracy of the Framingham risk function was evaluated by Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square goodness of fit test (calibration), and ROC curve (discrimination). The estimated 10-year risk of CHD by the Framingham risk function (12.8 %) was significantly lower than the observed risk (16.4 %) in 646 men, p=0.013. However, the trend in the 10-year incidence of CHD was significantly increasing with quintiles of the estimated risk, p<0.001. The Framingham risk function classified men into those with and without CHD in the 10-year period with accuracy over 60 %.","","Cílem bylo ověřit platnost framinghamské riziková funkce ischemické choroby srdeční (ICHS) u mužů z České republiky.

Although the problem is in general undecidable, we prove termination of abstraction refinement based verification and falsification of such properties for the class of non-linear robust discrete-time hybrid systems. We argue, that—in industrial practice—safety critical control applications give rise to hybrid systems that are robust.

However, our experience with building application of components is that the existing advanced component models (such as those offering component nesting, behavior specification and checking, dynamic reconfiguration to some extent, etc.) are subject to a lot of limitations and issues which prevent them from being accepted more widely (by industry in particular). We claim that these issues are specifically related to (a) the lack of support for dynamic reconfigurations of hierarchical architectures, (b) poor support for modeling and extendibility of the control part of a component, and (c) the lack of support for different communication styles applied in inter-component communication. In this paper, we show how these problems can be addressed and present an advanced component system SOFA 2.0 as a proof of the concept.

Tvrdíme, že tyto problémy se vztahují zejména k (a) nedostatku podpory pro dynamické rekonfigurace hierarchických architektur, (b) špatné podpoře modelování a rozšiřitelnosti kontrolní části komponenty a (c) nedostatečné podpoře pro různé komunikační styly, používané v propojení komponent. V tomto článku ukazujeme, jak lze tyto problémy řešit a předkládáme pokročilý komponentový systém SOFA 2.0.

We start with classical methods of cluster analysis which seem to be relevant in approaching to cluster Web data. The graph clustering is also described since its methods contribute significantly to clustering Web data. A use of artificial neural networks for clustering has the same motivation. Based on previously presented material, the core of the chapter provides an overview of approaches to clustering in the Web environment. Particularly, we focus on clustering web search results, in which clustering search engines arrange the search results into groups around a common theme. We conclude with some general considerations concerning the justification of so many clustering algorithms and their application in the Web environment.","","Kapitola poskytuje přehled některých shlukovacích metod, včetně jejich principů, vhodných pro shlukování v kolekcích dokumentů a v konečném důsledku i v prostředí internetu, zejména pak v prostředí služby World Wide Web.

The proposed strategy combines a convenient mathematical model, efficient combinatorial algorithms which are robust with respect to changes in the VO structure, and an efficient implementation. The mathematical model uses properties of weighted hypergraphs. Model flexibility enables to describe basic security relations between the nodes such that these relations are preserved under frequent changes in connections of the hypergraph nodes. The algorithms support construction of a VO with embedded security concepts on a given set of nodes. The proposed implementation makes use of the techniques developed for time and space-critical applications in numerical linear algebra.

The basic idea is to decompose a probability table into a series of tables, such that the table that is the sum of the series is equal to the original table. Each table in the series has the same domain as the original table but can be expressed as a product of one-dimensional tables. Entries in tables are allowed to be any real number, i.e. they can be also negative numbers. The possibility of having negative numbers, in contrast to a multiplicative decomposition, opens new possibilities for a compact representation of probability tables. We show that tensor rank-one decomposition can be used to reduce the space and time requirements in probabilistic inference. We provide a closed form solution for minimal tensor rank-one decomposition for some special tables and propose a numerical algorithm that can be used in cases when the closed form solution is not known.","","Navrhujeme nový součtový rozklad pravděpodobnostních tabulek - rozklad na tenzory ranku jedna. Základní myšlenka je, rozložit pravděpodobnostní tabulku na posloupnost tabulek, jejichž součet je roven původní tabulce. Každá z tabulek v posloupnosti má stejný obor indexů jako původní tabulka, ale je vyjádřitelná jako součin jednorozměrných tabulek. Prvky tabulek mohou být libovolná reálná čísla, tedy i čísla záporná. Ukazujeme, že rozklad na tenzory ranku jedna může být použit pro zmenšení prostorové a časové složitosti pravděpodobnostní inference.

Radial fuzzy systems are fuzzy systems exhibiting the radial property in antecedents of their rules. A fuzzy system has nominal consequents if its output is defined on a finite unordered set of possible actions. The question of coherence is the question of under which conditions we are assured that regardless the input to the system is, an output of the system exists, i.e., the output is non-empty. In other words, a fuzzy system is coherent if it has no contradictory rules in its rule base. In the paper we state sufficient conditions for a radial I-FS with nominal consequents to be coherent.","","V příspěvku je diskutován problém identifikace a zajištění kohrence, tedy vnitřní bezespornosti, báze pravidel pro třídu radiálních implikačních fuzzy systémů s nominálními konsekventy.

In this paper we investigate expansions of Product Logic by adding into the language a countable set of truth-constants, for example one truth-constant for each rational number in [0, 1], and by adding the corresponding book-keeping axioms for the truth-constants. We first show that the corresponding logics are algebraizable, and hence complete with respect to the variety of corresponding algebras. The main result of the paper is the canonical standard completeness of these logics, that is, theorems of them are exactly the 1-tautologies of the algebra defined over the real unit interval where the truth-constants are interpreted as their own values.","","Produktová logika je axiomtické rozšíření Hájkovy základní fuzzy logiky BL (Basic Logic), která zahrnuje 1-tautologie, když se silná konjunkce a implikace interpretují jako součin reálných čísel na intervalu [0,1], resp. jemu příslušné reziduum. V tomto článku se zabýváme rozšířením produktové logiky přidáním spočetné množiny pravdivostních konstant do jazyka, například jednu pravdivostní konstantu pro každé racionální číslo v [0,1], a přidáním přidáním souvisejících uspořádávajích axiomů pro pravdivostní konstanty.

The aim of this paper is to discuss numerical behavior of several nonsymmetric iterative methods applied for solving the saddle point systems via the Schur complement reduction or the null-space projection approach. Krylov subspace methods often produce the iterates which fluctuate rather strongly. Here we address the question whether large intermediate approximate solutions reduce the final accuracy of these two-level (inner-outer) iteration algorithms. We extend our previous analysis obtained for symmetric saddle point problems and distinguish between three mathematically equivalent back-substitution schemes which lead to a different numerical behavior when applied in finite precision arithmetic. Theoretical results are then illustrated on a simple model example.","","Nesymetrické sedlobodové soustavy se vyskytují ve velkém množství aplikací výpočetní matematiky. Cílem této publikace je popsat numerické chování nesymetrických iteračních metod pro řešení sedlobodových soustav metodou redukce na Schurův doplněk nebo metodou projekce na nulový prostor mimodiagonálního bloku. Je známo, že Krylovovské metody v těchto případech často generují aproximace s vysoce oscilující normou. V této práci se věnujeme problému zda aproximace s velkou normou ovllivňují limitní přesnost těchto dvojúrovňových algoritmů.

Even thought these environments have their specific issues, they also have some common problems, e.g. security. Our approach is based on the structure of Virtual Organizations, which can be defined as dynamic coalition of group of users and institutions that share resources with precisely defined rules when and what to share, for security improvements in information and also resource sharing within mentioned environments. Our approach uses mathematical model of hypergraphs. The paper also presents a set of rules for creating and managing groups of users in dynamic VOs.

The method uses simulated annealing, so it is quite computationally expensive. However, this allows to adjust the soft thresholds in groups of the nodes simultaneously in a way that better captures interactions between several predictors than the original approach. Our numerical test with data derived from an experiment in particle physics shows that besides the expected better approximation of the training data, also smaller generalization error is achieved.","","Článek zkoumá model klasifikačních stromů se změkčenými větveními, který zavedl Quinlan (1993) a je implementován v C4.5, ale s podstatně odlišným algoritmem pro trénování. Metoda využívá simulované žíhání a je tedy poměrně výpočetně náročná. Na druhé straně dovoluje nastavovat změkčená větvení ve skupinách uzlů způsobem, který lépe odpovídá interakcím mezi prediktory než v původní metodě.

In this work, we investigate sensitivity of Gauss-Christoffel quadrature with respect to small perturbations of the distribution function. To our knowledge, this sensitivity question has not been formulated and addressed in the literature, though several other sensitivity problems, motivated, in particular, by computation of the quadrature nodes and weights from moments, have been thoroughly studied by many authors. We survey existing particular results and show that even a small perturbation of a distribution function can cause large differences in Gauss-Christoffel quadrature estimates. We then discuss conditions under which the Gauss-Christoffel quadrature is insensitive under perturbation of the distribution function, present illustrative examples, and relate our observations to known conjectures on some sensitivity problems.","","Velmi důležitou otázkou při numerických výpočtech je otázka citlivosti dané funkce na změnu jejích argumentů.

A version of the ensemble Kalman Filter has been developed. The model-error covariance matrix is parametrized with the help of a covariance function and represented by an ensemble formed as a random selection from leading eigenvectors. The performance of the system is tested on the case of an ozone episode in June 2001. As a source of observations, the AirBase database has been used. Starting the forecast from analysed concentration fields improves the quality of forecast of the next day's ozone concentration maxima.","","V článku se navrhuje předpovědní systém založený na modelovém páru MM5 (numerický předpovědní model počasí) - CAMx (chemický transportní model).

Our aim is to propose an alternative of this notion of convergence supposing that the measure under consideration is a (complete) non-numerical and, in particular, lattice-valued possibilistic measure, i.e., a set function obeying the demand of (complete) maxitivity instead of that of sigma-additivity. Focusing our attention to sequences of sets converging in a lattice-valued possibilistic measure, some more or less elementary properties of such sequences are stated and proved.","","Elementární náhodné jevy potenciálně příznivé pro daný náhodný jev jsou definovány jako ty, pro které nejsme schopni v daném rámci možností dokázat, že nejsou příznivé pro uvažovaný náhodný jev.

Přesto zejména v kruzích počítačových teoretiků je opakovaně slyšet názory, že na kognici lze pořád možné pohlížet i „klasicky“, jako na problém specifického zpracování dat a že tudíž vtělení není nezbytné pro zachycení podstaty kognice. Ukážeme, že takto zjednodušený pohled opomíjí podstatnou vlastnost kognitivních systémů – a sice jejich aktivní vliv na výběr či dokonce vznik vstupních dat.","The modern theory of artificial cognitive systems sees these systems as autonomous embodied computational systems that situate themselves in the environment with the help of their sensomotoric units. Still, within the circles of computer theorists one can repeatedly hear an opinion that in principle cognition can be seen as a specific sort of computation and therefore one need not resort to embodiment in order to understand the nature of cognitive processes. We show that such a simplified view misses an essential part of cognitive systems – namely their active influencing the choice or even generation of their inputs.","","IN","","","Kognice a umělý život /6./.

This paper deals with tuning such parameters in situations when the values of the objective function have to be obtained in a costly experimental way. It suggests to use a neural-network based approximation of the objective function for parameter tuning in such situations. In this way, the convergence speed of the algorithm and the diversity of the population of points can be in vestigated for many various combinations of heuristic parameters. To construct the approximating neural network, some initial amount of data is needed, usually obtained from running the algorithm for several generations with default values.","","Evoluční optimalizační algoritmy obsahují díky své heuristické inspiraci mnoho heuristických parametrů, které je pro řádnou funkci algoritmu zapotřebí empiricky nastavit.

Navrhuje používat v takových situacích pro nastavování parametrů aproximaci cílové funkce pomocí neuronových sítí. Tímto způsobem lze pro mnoho různých kombinací heuristických parametrů zkoumat rychlost konvergence algoritmu a různorodost populace bodu.

However, most of the ANN-based rules extraction methods rely primarily on heuristics, and their underlying theoretical fundamentals are not very deep. That is especially much true for methods extracting fuzzy logic rules, which usually allow to mix different logical connectives in such a way that extracted rules can not be correctly evaluated in any particular fuzzy logic model. This paper shows that mixing of connectives is not needed. A method for the extraction of rules in a general fuzzy disjunctive normal form, for which the evaluation of the extracted rules in a single model is one of the basic principles, is described in detail and illustrated on EEG data.","","Získávání logických pravidel z dat je po téměř 15 roků klíčovou aplikací umělých neuronových sítí v dobývání znalostí z dat. Vetšina metod získávání pravidel založených na neuronových sítích však spočívá na heuristikách a jejich teoretické základy nejsou velmi hluboké. To platí zejména o metodách získávajících pravidla fuzzy logiky, které obvykle dovolují míchat různé logické spojky takovým způsobem, že pravdivostní hodnotu získaných pravidel nelze správně ohodnotit v žádném konkrétním modelu fuzzy logiky. Tento článek ukazuje, že takové míchání spojek není zapotřebí. Detailně je popsána metoda získávání pravidel v obecně fuzzy disjunktivní normální formě, pro niž je jedním ze základních principů ohodnotitelnost pravdivostní hodnoty v jediném modelu, a je ilustrována na EEG datech.","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2005","2006","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0132623","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We do believe that QoS and energy awareness are two of the most important parameters in wireless sensor networks. The protocol is completely distributed with no centralized control. The key idea is to introduce a resistance calculation for every connection in the network. The resistance reflects the distance to the sink together with energy capabilities of particular sensor. While the resistance is continually re-calculated, packets are sent to the sink via an appropriate path. Such a scheme allows to spend minimum messages on network management, whereby sensor network lifetime is extended and throughput remains high.","","Příspěvek představuje nový komunikační protokol RollingBall navržený pro bezdrátové senzorové sítě. RollingBall protokol je navržen tak, aby maximalizoval dobu životnosti sítě při zachování dobrých vlastností propustnosti dat (QoS). Doba životnosti společně s průchodností sítě patří, dle našeho mínění, mezi jedny z hlavních parametru , které ovlivňují nasazení senzorových v běžném prostředí. Protokol je plně distribuovaný a nevyužívá centrálního řízení pro svůj chod. Hlavní myšlenka příspěvku spočívá v možnosti modelovat senzorovou sít jako nakloněnou rovinu, kde náklon roviny bude určen parametry přímých spojení mezi sousedními senzory s tím, ze tyto parametry se budou v čase vyvíjet, tak aby odpovídali energetickým prostředkům dostupným v senzorech. Společně s tím je každému doručovanému paketu přidělen atribut určující jeho důležitost.

For the algorithm to work properly, those parameters need to be empirically tuned. If the values of the objective function have to be obtained in a costly experimental way, then the algorithm can not be run with several various combinations of the values of heuristic parameters. This paper suggests to use a neural-network based approximation of the objective function for parameter tuning in such situations. Such an aproach allows to investigate the convergence speed of the algorithm and the diversity of the population for many combinations of the values of heuristic parameters. A case study in materials science demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach.","","Heuristická inspirace genetických algoritmů má za následek jejich závislost na mnoha heuristických parametrech. Aby algoritmus řádně fungoval, tyto parametry je třeba empiricky nastavit. Musí-li být hodnoty cílové funkce získávány pomocí nakladných experimentů, není možné spouštět algoritmus několikrát s různými kombinacemi hodnot heuristických parametrů. Tento článek navrhuje používat v takových situacích aproximaci cílové funkce pomocí umělých neuronových sítí.

Pomocí metody umělých neuronových sítí jsme vytvořili několik modelů závislosti průtoku na srážkách a hodnotách průtoku v minulých letech. Neuronový model je pak schopen predikovat hodnoty průtoků na základě historických dat. Vypočtené průtoky mohou pomoci přo předpovědi povodňových stavů na řekách.","The article deals with studying rainfall-runoff relations on the Plouťnice catchment. With help of a method Artificial neural network we established few models of rainfall-runoff dependence in past days. The neural model then can predict runoff values onthe base of historical data. Calculated runoff can help with prediction of flooding on rivers.","","DA","","","Vodohospodářská konference /3./.

This paper proposes mechanisms that provide agents autonomous abilities in order to improve their performance within a multi-agent system. Our approach is utilizing an ontology-based description of agent and task types together with machine learning algorithms, such as evolutionary algorithms with logical reasoning. We propose a combination of an evolutionary algorithm and a formal logic resolution system which is able to create and verify new schemes. The approach is ilustrated on simple examples.","","Na hybridní výpočetní modely lze nahlížet jako na systémy výpočetních agentů. Tato práce navrhuje mechanismy, které agentům dodávají schopnosti autonomie a zlepšují tak jejich efektivitu v rámci multi-agentního systému. Náš přístup kombinuje popisy agentů, algoritmů a úloh pomocí ontologií s algoritmy strojového učení jako jsou evoluční algoritmy a logické zdůvodňování. Kombinace evolučního algoritmu s logickým zdůvodňovacím mechanismem, kterou navrhujeme, je schopna vytvářet a verifikovat nová schémata řešení. Přístup je ilustrován jednoduchými příklady.","BA","","","","UIVT-O","Ústav informatiky AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Computer Science of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2003","2005","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0017371","","","","","","","","","","","",""
