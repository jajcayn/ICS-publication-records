The introduction of new techniques has often been justifed by invoking the nonlinearity of the problem. First, we introduce a nonlinear measure of statistical dependence. Second, we analyse the linear and the nonlinear autocorrelation functions of the Czech electric comsumption. Third, we compare the predictions of nonlinear models with linear models.","","","BB","","","","UTIA-B","Ústav teorie informace a automatizace AV ČR, v. v. i.","Institute of Information Theory and Automation of the ASCR, v. v. i.","1","2000","","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/11104/0130583","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These parameters are later used for the training of ANN. We recognised that the approach based on mathematical logic, i.e. the GUHA method is also suitable for the determination of markers. Besides the minimisation of the number of elements in the input layer of ANN, also the number of neurons in hidden layers must be optimised.","","","BA","","","SOFSEM 2000 /27./.

To explore interaction from a computational viewpoint, we describe a generic model of an 'interactive machine' which interacts with the environment using single streams of input and output signals over a simple alphabet. Viewing the interactive machines as transducers of infinite streams of signals, we show that their interactive recognition and generation capabilities are identical.","","","BA","invited paper","","MFCS'2000.

The neural network has been used for fundamental frequency determination and for the duration of phonemes in prosody modelling. For the minimisation of the number of input parameters and for the reduction of the neural net structure redundancy, the GUHA method and pruning of neural networks can be suitable tools.","","BD","","","International Conference on Signal and Image Processing.

Applying a modeling language, such as UML, while dealing with these issues is desirable. Based on the composite structures framework, the emerging standard UML 2.0 defines a hierarchical component model; here, behavior of components may be specified with use cases. UML 2.0 provides four behavior specification mechanisms. The key goal of this paper is to evaluate whether and how these behavior specification mechanisms address the issues above.","","Návrh komponent a jejich skládaní do architektury neoddělitelně zahrnuje popis jejich chování. Využití nějakého modelovacího jazyka (například UML) přináší mnoho výhod. Nový standard pro UML - UML 2.0 - definuje hierarchický model komponent, ve kterém lze chování komponent specifikovat pomocí use case. UML 2.0 poskytuje čtyři mechanismy pro popis chování.
